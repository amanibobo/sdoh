for myself, remeber to download conda on my main computer and also use onedrive to access NOTEEVENTS file if needed.

## Project Title:

Creating a High Quality Synthetic Dataset with Annotated Social Determinants of Health Using Data Engineering

## (Original) Project Description:

This project proposes a comprehensive approach to data engineering, focusing on the extraction and refinement of social determinants of health (SDOH) from clinical notes to create a robust dataset for language model optimization. Utilizing ICEHAMMER (GTRIâ€™s unclassified high-performance computing cluster), the student will employ Python to create synthetic datasets with annotated social determinants of health data. The objective is to iteratively create these datasets to produce a high-quality dataset to be used for language model fine-tuning downstream. The student will be introduced to the process of data engineering, encompassing the extraction, cleaning, and annotation of data. The student will learn the technical skills necessary for handling complex datasets, as well as best practices in data engineering. By the end of the project, the student will have contributed to the development of a high-quality dataset, ready for language model fine-tuning, and gained experience in the field of data engineering. There will no special training required for the student and the student will use a basic computer to complete these tasks.
