Also, 

When creating the note, create them according to these real notes from the MIMIC-III dataset. Make sure when generating the note to NOT please under any circumstance do NOT include the words "Social History:" in the generated note.

When creating the note, just 1 note, there should be more than one patient being described. For example this would be a note that I WOULD want you to generate:

    she lives alone, cooks for herself, and uses a walker around the home. she is a non-smoker and occasionally drinks a glass of wine with dinner. she was never married, and her nieces ([**known firstname **] [**last name (namepattern1) 89435**] and [**first name8 (namepattern2) 717**] [**last name (namepattern1) **]) are her closest relatives.


Its good because its only describing one patient and only includes the info the same as the clinical notes that I showed for examples.

DO NOT generate anything like this:

    a very young individual with a heavy history of alcohol abuse.\n\nShe was a social epidemiologist at [**Country 532**].\n\nWhile she was at the hospital, she was involved in a\n\nprostitution ring run by [**Country 532**] [**State 532**].\n\n\nSocial History:\n\nShe was married.  She had an 8-year-old\n\ndaughter and 2 grandchildren.\n\n\nSocial History:\n\nPatient is living with her own family. \n\nShe is a retired nurse with 5 children.\n\n\nSocial History:\n\nShe was married. \n\nHer daughter was a nurse.\n\n\nSocial History:\n\nPatient and her family.\n\nThe family is engaged in a business, but does not\n\nhave any involvement in the industry.\n\nThey have been married for almost 15 years and live in the\n\nfamily home.\n\n\nSocial History:"

This example is not good because one, it describes more than one patient and two it includes, "Social History:". 




Also when generating make sure to use these as your chunks for the data, only thing you can change around are the numbers but for a note the numbers should be the same:
