Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Amlodipine

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1561**]
Chief Complaint:
81 yo F smoker w/ COPD, severe TBM, s/p tracheobronchoplasty [**5-5**]
s/p perc trach [**5-13**]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchoscopy 3/31,4/2,3,[**6-12**], [**5-17**], [**5-19**]
s/p trachealplasty [**5-5**]
percutaneous tracheostomy [**5-13**] after failed extubation
down size trach on [**5-25**] to size 6 cuffless


History of Present Illness:
This 81 year old woman has a history of COPD. Over the past five

years she has had progressive difficulties with her breathing.
In
[**2118-6-4**] she was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for respiratory failure
due
to a COPD exacerbation. Due to persistent hypoxemia, she
required
intubation and a eventual bronchoscopy on [**2118-6-9**] revealed marked

narrowing of the airways on expiration consistent with
tracheomalacia.
She subsequently underwent placement of two
silicone stents, one in the left main stem and one in the
trachea. During the admission the patient had complaints of
chest
pain and ruled out for an MI. She was subsequently discharged to

[**Hospital1 **] for physical and pulmonary rehab. Repeat bronchoscopy
on
[**2118-8-1**] revealed granulation tissue at the distal right lateral
wall of the tracheal stent. There was significant malacia of the

peripheral and central airways with complete collapse of the
airways on coughing and forced expiration. Small nodules were
also noted on the vocal cords. She has noticed improvement in
her
respiratory status, but most recently has been in discussion
with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**] regarding possible tracheobronchial plasty

with mesh. Tracheal stents d/c [**2119-4-19**] in anticipation of
surgery.
In terms of symptoms, she describes many years of intermittent
chest pain that she describes as left sided and occurring at any

time. Currently, she notices it about three times a week, and
states that it seems to resolve after three nitroglycerin.
She currently is dependent on oxygen and wears 1.5-2 liters
around the clock. She has frequent coughing and brings up ""dark
sputum"".

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
COPD exacerbation/Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
arterial line placement
PICC line placement
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy


History of Present Illness:
87 yo F with h/o CHF, COPD on 5 L oxygen at baseline,
tracheobronchomalacia s/p stent, presents with acute dyspnea
over several days, and lethargy. This morning patient developed
an acute worsening in dyspnea, and called EMS. EMS found patient
tachypnic at saturating 90% on 5L. Patient was noted to be
tripoding. She was given a nebulizer and brought to the ER.
.
According the patient's husband, she was experiencing symptoms
consistent with prior COPD flares. Apparently patient was
without cough, chest pain, fevers, chills, orthopnea, PND,
dysuria, diarrhea, confusion and neck pain. Her husband is a
physician and gave her a dose of levaquin this morning.
.
In the ED, patient was saturating 96% on NRB. CXR did not reveal
any consolidation. Per report EKG was unremarkable. Laboratory
evaluation revealed a leukocytosis if 14 and lactate of 2.2.
Patient received combivent nebs, solumedrol 125 mg IV x1,
aspirin 325 mg po x1. Mg sulfate 2 g IV x1, azithromycin 500 mg
IVx1, levofloxacin 750 mg IVx1, and Cefrtiaxone 1g IVx1. Patient
became tachpnic so was trialed on non-invasive ventilation but
became hypotensive to systolics of 80, so noninvasive was
removed and patient did well on NRB and nebulizers for about 2
hours. At that time patient became agitated, hypoxic to 87% and
tachypnic to the 40s, so patient was intubated. Post intubation
ABG was 7.3/60/88/31. Propafol was switched to
fentanyl/midazolam for hypotension to the 80s. Received 2L of
NS. On transfer, patient VS were 102, 87/33, 100% on 60% 450 x
18 PEEP 5. Patient has peripheral access x2.
.
In the ICU, patient appeared comfortable.

CXR ([**2124-7-21**]) - IMPRESSION: Hiatal hernia, otherwise
unremarkable. Limited exam.

Echo ([**2124-7-24**]) - There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular systolic function. Moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

CXR ([**2124-8-5**]) - Kyphotic positioning. Compared with one day
earlier and allowing for technical differences, the right-sided
effusion may be slightly larger. Otherwise, no significant
change is detected. Again seen is retrocardiac opacity
consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation
and a small left effusion. As noted, a right effusion is again
seen, possibly slightly larger on the current examination, with
underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Doubt CHF.
Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
87 yo F with h/o CHF, COPD on 5 L oxygen at baseline,
tracheobronchomalacia s/p stent, presents with acute dyspnea
over several days, no s/p intubation for hypercarbic respiratory
failure.

# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Presents with dyspnea, but no
clear cough or fevers. Per report, patient felt like this with
prior COPD exacerbations. Leukocytosis supports possible
pneumonia, but history and CXR not entirely consistent with
this. EKG with signs of demand, but ROMI negative. Sputum gram
stain unremarkable, but respitatory viral culture grew
parainfluenze type 3 on [**7-24**]. Patient was initially managed on
solumedrol 60 mg IV Q8H, and was eventually tapered. With no
evidence of pneumonia on CXR and sputum gram stain, antibiotics
were stopped [**7-25**]. Beta-agonists and anticholinergics were
continued around the clock. TTE revealed mild symmetric lvh with
normal ef, increased pcwp (>18mmHg), Normal RV, and moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. On [**7-26**], bronchoscopy
revealed collapsible, unremarkable airways. Patient had
difficulty weaning from the vent, and would become
interimittenty hypertensive to SBP 200s and tachypnic to the
50s. Patient was extubatied on [**7-27**] after passing SBT 0/5, but
required re-intubation 30 minutes later for worsening
secretions, lack of gag reflex, and tachypnea to the 50s. Of
note, on [**8-1**], the patient was found to have MRSA growing in
sputum samples. Although it was felt that this likely
represented colonization as opposed to true infection, the
patient was started on a course of vancomycin (which was stopped
after 5 days). After multiple discussions between the patient's
family and the ICU team, the patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] the palliative
care service, the patient's family ultimately decided that she
would not want a tracheostomy. On [**2124-8-3**], extubation was pursued
again and was successful. After extubation, her respiratory
status improved and she was ultimately called out to the medical
floor. On the floor she was progressively weaned to 2LNC with
nebs (better than her baseline 5L @home). Because of clinical
exams revealing mild volume overload, she was intermittently
diuresed. She also experienced intermittent shortness of breath
with tachypnea but this was thought to be the result of attacks
of anxiety with tachypnea. After receiving prn morphine, her
breathing status would typically improve. A steroid taper was
begun. The patient should continue prednisone 30 mg daily for 3
more days, then 20 mg daily for 4 days, then 10 mg daily for 4
days, then 5 mg daily for 4 days, then stop.
.
# Upper GI bleeding: On [**7-22**], patient had coffee grounds from OG
tube. Lavage for approx 600ccs with clearance. GI perfomred EGD
which revealed esophagitis, ulcers and blood in the stomach
body, D2 diverticulum and large hiatal hernia. H pylori was
negative. Patient was continued on IV PPI, with plan for repeat
EGD in 8 weeks, and upper GI series once clinically improved
given abnormal anatomy on EGD. Her hematocrit remained stable
with no further episodes of upper GI bleeding throughout the
patient's hospitalization. On the floor she was switched to PO
pantoprazole twice daily. Aspirin was held.
.
# Weakness: The patient was found to have generalized weakness
at the end of her hospitalization. Neurology was consulted and
they felt it was likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy
and deconditioning from her prolonged bedbound status. A TSH was
checked which was normal. They recommended pulmonary and
physical rehab.
.
# CAD: History of LAD and RCA stenosis on Cath, but no stents.
Continued statin and beta blocker, but held aspirin for GI
bleeding (see above)
.
# Nutrition: Unable to pass NG without direct visualization due
to hiatal hernia. IR guided post pyloric NG tube was placed on
[**7-26**] for TFs and po medications. NG tube was pulled when patient
was extubated on [**2124-8-3**]. Speech and swallow were consulted
following the patient's extubation and she was eventually moved
to soft solids and thin liquids with 1:1 supervision.

# Goals of care: PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1407**] was very involved in discussions
regarding patient's code status. Palliative care also followed
along with the patient. Ultimately, at the time of the patient's
extubation on [**2124-8-3**], it was decided that the patient would be
DNR/DNI (although this was later change). The patient's family
felt that she would not want a tracheostomy. It was decided that
she would not be reintubated and that, if her respiratory status
were to worsen after intubation, care would be focused on
comfort. However, her status improved in the MICU and on the
floor and it was then decided that she would remain DNR with
intubation (but no tracheostomy) if her breathing deteriorated.
After several days with stable or improved overall clinical
status, she was deemed suitable for rehabilitation. At the timem
of discharge, the patient's code status was do not resuscitate,
okay to intubate.

   RADIOLOGY
==================

CT scan C spine [**2162-3-3**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Fracture of the C6 as described involving the right pedicle
(extending to the inferior facet) and left lamina. Anterior
widening at the C6-7 disc space and mild widening of left C6-7
facet also noted. Prevertebral hematoma at C6 with likely
rupture of the anterior longitudinal ligament.

2.  Lucency in the right posterior C1 ring may represent a
chronic injury.
Likely old avulsion fracture at T2 pedicle on the left.

3. Ossification of both anterior and posterior longitudinal
ligaments with
compromise of the central spinal canal. Degenerative disease is
further
described above.

CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS ([**2162-3-3**])
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute injuries in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis.
2. Three discrete pleural fluid collections in the right
hemithorax, likely pseudotumors.
3. Small hypodense lesion in the pancreatic body is of unclear
etiology, may represent pseudicyst or cystic tumor. Further
evaluation with MRI may be performed on a non- emergent basis.
4. Bilateral renal cysts.
5. Foley catheter balloon inflated within the prostatic urethra.
Recommend emergent repositioning.

CT SINUS/MAXILLOFACIAL ([**2162-3-3**])
1. Bilateral nasal bone fractures.
2. Left frontal scalp hematoma with preseptal soft tissue
swelling. Question foreign body anterior to the left globe.
Recommend clinical correlation. Small amount of extraconal
hematoma in the superior aspect of the left orbit.
3. Linear lucency in the right posterior ring of C1. Correlate
with CT C- spine performed concurrently.

HEAD CT ([**2162-3-3**])
1. No acute intracranial hemprrhage.
2. Left frontal scalp hematoma.
3. Nasal bone fractures. Recommend correlation with report from
facial bone CT scan.
4. Lucency in the right posterior ring of C1. Please refer to
dedeicated CT C-spine for further detail.
5. Left cerebellar encephalomalacia, likely due to old
infarction.

CHEST [**2162-3-10**]
The Dobbhoff tube passes below the diaphragm with its tip most
likely terminating in the stomach. The bilateral pacemakers are
demonstrated with one lead terminating in right atrium and three
leads terminating in right ventricle. The patient is in mild
pulmonary edema with no change in the loculated pleural fluid
within the major fissure.

CT HEAD [**2162-3-11**]
1. A tiny amount of intraventricular hemorrhage layers along the
occipital horns of the ventricles bilaterally. Recommend followp
imaging.
2. Left frontal scalp hematoma has decreased in size.
3. Unchanged left cerebellar encephalomalacia.
4. Nasal bone fractures are better evaluated on dedicated
maxillofacial CT.

RIGHT SHOULDER X-RAY ([**2162-3-11**])
Mild glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis.
Nonspecific ossification projecting over the upper margin of the
scapular body and adjacent to the lesser tuberosity. Diagnostic
considerations include the sequela of chronic calcific bursitis,
intraarticular bodies, and/or calcific tendinitis of the
subscapularis tendon.
Increased opacity projecting over the right hemithorax and minor
fissure, better delineated on recent chest radiographs and chest
CT

RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND ([**2162-3-13**])
1. Deep venous thrombosis in the right axillary vein, extending
proximally into the right subclavian vein, and distally to
involve the brachial veins, portion of the basilic vein, and the
right cephalic vein.
2. Likely 2.0 cm left axillary lymph node, with unusual
son[**Name (NI) 493**] features somewhat suspicious for malignancy.
Followup ultrasound is recommended in 4 weeks, and FNA/biopsy
may be considered at that time if no interval improvement.

[**2162-3-14**]
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There are small-to-moderate
bilateral pleural effusions, on the right with a loculated
appearance. There is associated compressive atelectasis. The
visualized portion of the heart suggests mild cardiomegaly.
There is no pericardial effusion. There is a 9-mm
hypoattenuating, well-defined lesion in the left lobe of the
liver (2:12) too small to accurately characterize but
statistically most likely representing a cyst. There are
bilateral, partially exophytic renal cysts. The spleen is normal
in size. There is a 5-mm hypoattenuating focus in the pancreatic
body, most likely representing focal fat. The gallbladder and
adrenal glands are unremarkable. An NG tube terminates in the
stomach. There is no ascites. The large and small bowel loops
appear unremarkable without wall thickening or pneumatosis. Oral
contrast material has passed into the ascending colon without
evidence of obstruction. There is no ascites and no free air.
There is a small pocket of air in the left rectus muscle,
tracking over a distance of approximately 10 cm.

CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The pelvic small and large bowel
loops, collapsed bladder containing Foley catheter and seminal
vesicles appear unremarkable. The prostate is enlarged,
measuring 5.9 cm in transverse diameter. The rectum contains a
moderate amount of dried stool. There is no free air or free
fluid.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. There is
DISH of the entire visualized thoracolumbar spine. There also
are degenerative changes about the hip joints with large
acetabular osteophytes.

IMPRESSION:
1. Stable bilateral pleural effusions, loculated on the right.
2. New focus of air tracking within the left rectus muscle with
associated tiny amount of extraperitoneal air (2:53). No
associated stranding or fluid collection. Please correlate
clinically if this could be iatrogenic, such as due to s.q.
injections.
3. 5-mm hypoattenuating focus in the pancreatic body. This could
represent focal fat, although a cystic tumor cannot be excluded.
If this is of concern, then MRI is again recommended for further
evaluation.
4. Hypoattenuating focus in the left lobe of the liver, too
small to accurately characterize.
5. Bilateral partially exophytic renal cysts.
6. Moderate amount of dried stool within the rectum.

A wet read was placed and the pertinent findings were discussed
by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1831**] [**Name (STitle) 1832**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1833**] at 11:30 p.m. on [**2162-3-14**].

[**2162-3-16**]
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW FINDINGS: Real-time video
fluoroscopic evaluation was performed after oral administration
of thin and puree consistency of barium, in conjunction with the
speech pathologist.

ORAL PHASE: Normal bolus formation, bolus control, AP tongue
movement, oral transit time, and no oral cavity residue.

PHARYNGEAL PHASE: There is normal swallow initiation and velar
elevation. There is mild-to-moderate impairment of laryngeal
elevation with absent epiglottic deflection. There is
moderate-to-severe increase in pharyngeal transit time. There is
residue in the valleculae and piriform sinuses with moderate
impairment of bolus propulsion. There was aspiration of both
thin and puree barium.

IMPRESSION: Aspiration of thin liquids and puree. For additional
information, please see the speech and swallow therapist's
report from the same day.

[**2162-3-18**] CT Head w/out:
FINDINGS: There is a small amount of blood layering in the
occipital horns of both lateral ventricles, unchanged though not
as dense given evolution. No new hemorrhage is identified. The
ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are enlarged secondary to
involutional change. Periventricular white matter hyperdensities
are sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemia. Encephalomalacia
in the left cerebellar hemisphere secondary to old infarction is
unchanged. The osseous structures are unremarkable. The
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
Skin staples are noted along the superior- posterior neck
secondary to recent spinal surgery.

IMPRESSION: No interval change with a very small
intraventricular hemorrhage.

No discharge labs as patient CMO.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1829**] was seen at [**Hospital1 18**] after his fall from a height
of approximatly 10 feet.  CT scans of his chest, abdomen and
pelvis were negative for pathology.  CT scan of his C-spine
showed fracture of anterior and posterior elements at C6-7.  He
was also shown to have a right nasal bone fracture.

C-spine fracture: Mr. [**Known lastname 1829**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] two surgical

History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname 622**] [**Known lastname 1836**] is a 62-year-old woman, with longstanding
history of rheumatoid arthritis, probable Sweet's syndrome, and
multiple joint complications requiring orthopedic interventions.
She was found to hve a right cavernous sinus and nasopharyngeal
mass.  She underwent a biopsy of hte nasopharyngeal mass by Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1837**] and the pathology, including flow
cytometry,
was reactive for T-cell lymphoid hyperplasia only.

She has a longstanding history of rheumatoid arthritis that
involved small and large joints in her body.  Her disease is
currently controlled by abatacept, hydroxychloroquine, and
methotrexate.  She also has a remote history of erythematous
nodules at her shins, dermatosis (probable Sweet's disease),
severe holocranial headache with an intensity of [**9-28**], and
dysphagia.  But her symptoms resolved with treatment for
autoimmune disease.  Please refer additional past medical
history, past surgical history, facial history, and social
history to the initial note on [**2171-11-4**].

She cam to the BTC for discussion about management of her right
cavernous sinus mass that extends into the middle cranial fossa.


She had a recent head CT at the [**Hospital1 756**] and Woman's Hospital on
[**2171-11-29**], when she went for a consultation there.
She is neurologically stable without headache, nausea, vomiting,
seizure, imbalance, or fall. She has no new systemic complaints.

Her neurological problem started [**9-/2171**] when she experienced
frontal pressure-like sensations.  There was no temporal
pattern;
but they may occur more often in the evening.
She had fullness in her ear and she also had a cold coinciding
to
the onset of her headache.  By late [**Month (only) 359**] and early [**2171-10-21**], she also developed a sharp pain intermittently in the
right
temple region.
She did not have nausea, vomiting, blurry vision, imbalance, or
fall.  A gadolinium-enhanced head MRI, performed at [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2171-10-30**], showed a bright mass
involving the cavernous sinus.

Past Medical History:
She has a history of rheumatoid arthritis unspecified
dermatosis, right knee replacement, left hip replacement, and
fusion of subtalar joint, and resection of a benign left parotid
gland tumor.


Social History:
She is married.  She had smoked for approximately a year and a
half when she was younger, but is not currently smoking.  She
has approximately one glass of wine per week.  She is retired
but was employed as a teacher.


Family History:
Cancer, diabetes, hearing loss, and heart disease.


Physical Exam:
AF VSS
HEENT normal
no LNN
Neck supple.

Neurological Examination:  Her Karnofsky Performance Score is
100.  She is neurologically intact.


Pertinent Results:
MRI [**3-5**]
Right middle cranial fossa mass likely represents a meningioma
and is stable since MRI of [**2172-2-11**]. The previously seen
midline nasopharyngeal mass has decreased in size since MRI of
[**2168-2-11**]. Direct visual inspection would be helpful for
further assessment of the nasopharyngeal mass.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient presented electively for meningioma resection of [**3-5**].
She tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the
operating room. She was trasnported to the ICU post-operatively
for management. She had no complications and was transferred to
the floor and observed for 24 hours. Prelim path is consistent
with meningioma.
She has dissolvable sutures, and will need to come to
neurosurgery clinic in [**6-28**] days for wound check only.
She will need to be scheduled for brain tumor clinic. She will
complete Decadron taper on [**3-10**] and then restart her maintenance
dose of prednisone. She will also be taking Keppra for seizure
prophlyaxis.
Her neurologic examination was intact with no deficits at
discharge. She was tolerating regular diet. She should continue
to take over the counter laxatives as needed.

[**2112-12-8**] PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The heart size and
mediastinal contours are within normal limits. No definite
pleural effusions are seen. There is diffusely increased
interstitial opacity disease, predominantly in the lower lung
zones. No pneumothorax seen. The osseous structures are stable.
A hiatal hernia is noted. Tiny left pleural effusion is noted.

IMPRESSION: Diffusely increased interstitial opacities. This
appearance is consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion
superimposed upon chronic interstitial changes.
.
[**2112-12-9**] IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-19**] and
[**12-8**]:

Severe progressive interstitial abnormality accompanied by
pulmonary and mediastinal vascular congestion is most likely
edema, but severe interstitial pneumonia either infectious or
drug related could simulate these findings. Chronic hiatus
hernia unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
82 yo F with CAD, CHF, HTN, recent PE ([**10-17**]), who presents from
rehab with PNA and hypoxia.
.
Chest x-ray revealed bilateral infiltrates. Patient was started
on Zosyn and vancomycin for pneumonia. Her fluid status was
closely monitored given her underlying CHF. On admission her
daughters were in disagreement over her code status and her
original long standing DNR/DNI status was changed to allow for
intubation if needed. However, when the patient's respiratory
status continued to decline to the point of need for intubation,
the patient refused intubation. Her family was notified and
agreed that their mother's wishes should be fulfilled.  She was
started on IV morphine then converted to morphine drip on HD #3
for comfort and all other medications were discontinued. Her
family was at her bedside and their Rabbi was called. She died
on [**2112-12-10**] at 2:20 pm. An autopsy was offered, but the family
declined.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2-25**] Left Craniotomy for mass resection


History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 1852**] is a 62-year-old left-handed man who is here for a
follow up of his left sphenoid meningioma.  I last saw him on
[**2149-11-17**] and his head CT showed growth of the left sphenoid
meningioma.  He is seizure free.  Today, he is here with his
wife
and daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] does not have headache, nausea, vomiting,
urinary incontinence, or fall.

His neurological problem began on [**2142-6-22**] when he became
confused and disoriented in a hotel bathroom.  At that time, he
was visiting his daughter for a wedding.  His wife found him
slumped over in the bath tube.  According to her, his eyes
looked
funny.  He could not stand up.  His verbal output did not make
sense.  He was brought to [**Doctor First Name 1853**] Hospital in Placentia,
CA.  He woke up 7 to 8 hours later in the emergency room.  He
felt very tired after the event.  He was hospitalized from
[**2142-6-22**] to [**2142-6-25**].  He had a cardiac pacemaker placement due
to irregular heart rate and bradycardia.  He also had a head MRI
that showed a less than 1 cm diameter sphenoid meningioma.


Past Medical History:
Cardiac arrhythmia as noted above, has a
pacemaker in place, prostate cancer with prostatectomy, and
hypertension.


Social History:
Lives with his wife.  Retired, works parttime
driving a school bus.

is 150/92.  Pulse is 80.  Respiration is 16.  His skin
has full turgor.  HEENT is unremarkable.  Neck is supple.
Cardiac examination reveals regular rate and rhythms.  His lungs
are clear.  His abdomen is soft with good bowel sounds.  His
extremities do not show clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

Neurological Examination:  His Karnofsky Performance Score is
100.  He is awake, alert, and oriented times 3.  There His
language is fluent with good comprehension.  His recent recall
is
intact.  Cranial Nerve Examination:  His pupils are equal and
reactive to light, 4 mm to 2 mm bilaterally.  Extraocular
movements are full.  There is no nystagmus.  Visual fields are
full to confrontation.  Funduscopic examination reveals sharp
disks margins bilaterally.  His face is symmetric.  Facial
sensation is intact bilaterally.  His hearing is intact
bilaterally.  His tongue is midline.  Palate goes up in the
midline.  Sternocleidomastoids and upper trapezius are strong.

strengths are [**5-16**] at all muscle groups.  His muscle tone is
normal.  His reflexes are 0 in upper and lower extremities
bilaterally.  His ankle jerks are absent.  His toes are
down going.  Sensory examination is intact to touch and
proprioception.  Coordination examination does not reveal
dysmetria.  His gait is normal.  He can do tandem.  He does not
have a Romberg.

PHYSICAL EXAM UPON DISCHARGE:
non focal
incision c/d/i, dissolvable sutures

Pertinent Results:
[**2-25**] CT Head: IMPRESSION:
1. Likely meningioma along the greater [**Doctor First Name 362**] of the left sphenoid
bone,
measuring 18 mm in diameter, unchanged since the most recent
study of [**11/2149**], with reactive bony changes, as above.
2. Bifrontal cortical atrophy, which has progressed slightly
over the series of studies since the earliest studies of [**2142**].

[**2-25**] CT Head: IMPRESSION:
Expected post-operative changes with the left frontal craniotomy
including
subcutaneous air and soft tissue swelling, moderate
pneumocephalus overlying predominantly the bilateral frontal
lobes, and foci of hemorrhage in the surgical bed. No evidence
of residual tumor on this non contrast CT.

[**2-26**] CXR: FINDINGS: The lung volumes are rather low. There is
moderate cardiomegaly without evidence of overt pulmonary edema.
No areas of atelectasis or pneumonia. Right pectoral pacemaker
in situ, with correct lead placement.


[**2-28**] Head CT /c contrast: IMPRESSION: Status post left frontal
craniotomy changes with improvement of pneumocephalus and stable
3 mm left to right midline shift; focus of hemorrhage
with/without residual tumor in the resection bed is similar in
appearance to prior exam but now with more surrounding vasogenic
edema. Stable appearance of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Followup to
assess for residual tumor/ interval change.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient presented electively on [**2-25**] for left sided craniotomy
for mass resection. he tolerated the procedure well and was
taken to the Trauma ICU post-operatively still intubated.
Shortly thereafter he was deemed fit for extubation which was
done without difficulty. At post-op check he was neurologically
intact.
On [**2-26**] he was neurologically intact and cleared for transfer to
the stepdown unit. This did not happen due to bed shortage. A CT
with contrast was ordered for post op evaluation.
On [**2-27**] he was again stable and cleared for transfer to the
floor. Decadron taper was initiated. He was seen by PT and
cleared for discharge home.
On [**2-28**] the patient was being prepped for discharge but was
noted to have intermittent heart rate in the 130-170's. His
other vitals were stable. Electrophysiology was consulted and
they recommended increasing the metoprolol XL dose to 100mg
Qday. The patient was kept overnight to monitor this new dose.
On [**3-1**] her remained stable neurologically and hemodynamically
therefore he was cleared for discharge.

Pathology Report from [**2118-8-10**]:
DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Brain, left frontal (A):
    1.  Vascular malformation consistent with arteriovenous
malformation
    of cortical [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter with radiation induced
fibrinoid
    necrosis.
    2.  Focal hemosiderin deposition suggesting prior
hemorrhages.
2.  Left frontal radionecrosis and residual AVM (B):
    1.  Vascular malformation consistent with arteriovenous
malformation
    of cortical [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter with radiation induced
fibrinoid
    necrosis.
    2.  Focal hemosiderin deposition suggesting prior
hemorrhages.
Clinical:  Radionecrosis.

CT Head post-op [**8-10**]:
FINDINGS: There is a left-sided frontal craniotomy with surgical
resection of the enhancing ""mass"" noted in previous studies.
There is extensive confluent hypodensity in the left
frontoparietal region, that likely represents post-radiation
vasogenic edema with resultant 8.5-mm shift of normally-midline
structures, not significantly changed from the previous MR.
There is a tiny focus of hyperdensity in the postoperative field
which may represent a small amount of hemorrhage. There is
expost-operative pneumocephalus and subcutaneous air noted.

IMPRESSION: Status post left craniotomy and resection of AVM and
possible
""mass""-like radiation necrosis, with small hyperdense focus in
the operative bed, likely representing very small hemorrhage.
Extensive vasogenic edema persists.




Brief Hospital Course:
Post-operatively she was admitted to the ICU for observation s/p
resection. Her Post-op head CT was negative for bleeding. She
remained intubated immediately post-op. She was weaned and
extubated on [**8-11**] and did very well neurologically. The patient
was transferred out of the ICU later that day. She was
ambulating without difficulty, her pain was well-controlled, and
she was taking in food with no nausea/vomiting. Her
post-operative MRI was done on [**8-12**] and showed expected
post-operative changes. She was discharged on [**2118-8-12**].

Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 1857**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central venous line insertion (right internal jugular vein)

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1858**] is an 84 yo man with moderate aortic stenosis (outside
hospital echo in [**2124**] with [**Location (un) 109**] 1 cm2, gradient 28 mmHg, moderate
mitral regurgitation, mild aortic insufficiency), chronic left
ventricular systolic heart failure with EF 25-30%, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, CAD s/p CABG in [**2099**] with
SVG-LAD-Diagonal, SVG-OM, and SVG-RPDA-RPL, with a re-do CABG in
[**9-/2117**] with LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM, SVG-diagonal, and SVG-RCA. He also
has severe peripheral arterial disease s/p peripheral bypass
surgery. He presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital ER this morning with
shortness of breath and chest pain and was found to be in heart
failure.

He states he was in his usual state of health until 10:30 last
evening when he woke up feeling cold; 1 hour later he developed
moderate to severe sharp chest pain radiating across his chest
associated with nausea, diaphoresis, and dypsnea. The pain was
fairly constant and did not resolve until he was given sL NTG at
6 am by EMS. He has been pain free since. Presenting vitals BP
109/66, HR 71, O2 sat 88% on RA. CXR showed congestive heart
failure; initial troponin-I was mildly elevated at 0.4, CK 70.
He given aspirin and furosemide 80 mg IV (with ~600cc diuresis),
Nitropaste [**1-3**]"", and Lovenox 80 mg SQ. During the ambulance
transfer to the [**Hospital1 18**], he also received ~500 cc IVF for ? low
BP).

On further questioning, Mr. [**Known lastname 1858**] has very poor exercise
tolerance due to knee pain that he attributes to osteoarthritis.
But he says that he gets chest pain (similar to pain he had last
night) with fairly minimal exertion (picking up his 11 lb cat,
carrying 1 gallon jug of water, first getting up from sitting to
walk outside or to walk to the bedroom). The pain is associated
with dyspnea and is relieved with few minutes rest. His symptoms
occur about every day to every other day and have been stable
over the past year. He denies orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, but does endorse exertional dyspnea (he cannot identify
the amount of exertion required). Currently, he is dyspneic and
feels somewhat better sitting up; he reports no chest pain.

ROS is also positive for a nose bleed requiring ED visit several
months ago (and cessation of Plavix for a few days), and
currently gross hematuria after Foley placement and Lovenox.

Past Medical History:
1. Coronary artery disease s/p CABG twice (vide infra).
2. Hypertension.
3. Diabetes mellitus.
4. Hyperlipidemia.
5. Peripheral arterial disease with occluded left common iliac
artery, S/P right iliac artery stenting and femoral-to-femoral
bypass, further angioplasty to the right profunda.
5. Ischemic cardiomyopathy and chronic LV systolic heart
failure, reported LVEF 25-30%.
6. Moderate-severe aortic stenosis.
7. Osteoarthritis.

CAD: Diabetes, Dyslipidemia, Hypertension

Cardiac History: CABG in [**2099**] (SVG-LAD-Diagonal, SVG-OM, and
SVG-RPDA-RPL), with a re-do CABG in [**9-/2117**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM,
SVG-diagonal, and SVG-RCA)

Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**2120**] anatomy as follows:
Patent SVG to OM1, patent SVG to PDA which filled the distal PDA
as well as the R-PL via a jump segment. Stump occlusion of a
graft presumably to the right system as well as one stump that
could be documented of a graft to the left. Other SVG's were not
able to be selectively engaged. Supravalvular aortography
demonstrated no other patent grafts. Patent LIMA to mid-LAD,
which also back-perfused the diagonal via a patent jump graft
that was interposed between the LAD and the diagonal.

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use. There is no history of alcohol abuse.

ECG [**2125-2-9**]  9:36:38 PM
Rhythm is most likely sinus rhythm with frequent ventricular
premature beats with occasional ventricular bigeminal pattern.
There are also frequent atrial premature beats. Intraventricular
conduction defect. Left ventricular hypertrophy. ST-T wave
changes most likely related to left ventricular hypertrophy.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2124-4-9**] ventricular premature
beats are more frequent, as are atrial premature beats. Clinical
correlation is suggested.

CXR [**2125-2-9**]: The patient is after median sternotomy and CABG.
The heart size appears slightly enlarged compared to the
previous study.  Bilateral perihilar haziness continues toward
the lower lungs is new consistent with new moderate- to-severe
pulmonary edema.  Bilateral pleural effusion is present, also
new, most likely part of the heart failure.   Left and right
retrocardiac opacities consistent with atelectasis.

ECHO [**2125-2-11**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with akinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolaterl
walls. There is mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF
= 25-30 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
is normal. with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis (area 0.6 cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**1-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior report (images
unavailable of [**2119-5-8**], left ventricular systolic function is now
depressed and the severity of aortic stenosis has increased.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 84 yo man with CAD s/p CABG twice with daily
angina, presenting with chest pain, dyspnea, and congestive
heart failure.

# CAD: The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup
and treatment of chest pain. A chest X-ray performed on
admission showed moderate-severe pulmonary edema. He did have a
stably elevated troponin thought to be related to acute heart
failure or demand ischemia. He was started on a Lasix drop at 10
mg/hr for initiation of diuresis. He initially tolerated this
well, however at approximately 8 pm on [**2125-2-10**], Mr. [**Known lastname 1858**] was
transferred from the floor to the CCU after complaining of chest
pain when he was sitting in bed after dinner. As he was being
evaluated by the housestaff, he became unresponsive and
developed pulseless electrical arrest. Chest compressions were
started, but within approximately 2 minutes, he became
responsive and regained a palpable pulse. His rhythm appeared to
be atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate initially in the
50s but rising to the 110's. Review of his telemetry showed that
he had developed atrial fibillation earlier in the evening
without obvious ventricular arrhythmias immediately prior to his
arrest (which was attributed to a vasovagal episode in the
setting of heart failure and aortic stenosis).  On transfer to
the CCU, he was started on levophed for hypotension and
amiodarone IV for AFib. Chest x-ray on [**2125-2-10**] showed interval
worsening of pulmonary edema, bilateral pleural effusions and
bibasilar atelectasis.  At this time his cardiac enzymes became
very elevated with EKG changes consistent of a NSTEMI with a CK
to 1006 and troponin to 3.82. On [**2125-2-11**], he had a transthoracic
echocardiogram which showed moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal half of the
inferior and inferolateral walls. LVEF was 25-30 %, with severe
aortic stenosis and [**1-3**]+ mitral regurgitation. He was
aggressively diuresed with an IV Lasix drip with improvement in
his oxygen requirement and chest x-ray.  Levophed was
discontinued on [**2-12**], and blood pressures remained stable off
pressors with MAP's 60 - 70.  On [**2125-2-13**], he was transferred
back to the floor team on PO amiodarone. He remained in normal
sinus rhythm on telemetry on po amiodarone, and diuresis was
continued with a Lasix drip with good urine output and
improvement of renal function. He remained asymptomatic with no
shortness of breath or chest pain after transfer. He was
maintained on a heparin drip bridging to Coumadin for paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation. His metoprolol was held for hypotension in
the ICU and relative hypotension with SBP in 90s and low 100s
upon transfer to the floor. ACE-inhibitor was held due to
relative hypotension and renal insufficiency with Creat 1.7. A
cardiac surgery consult deemed him an acceptable candidate for a
3rd open heart surgery for aortic valve replacement pending
re-assessment of his coronary anatomy. The intermediate-term
plan was to allow recovery from the current episode and
discussion as an outpatient with his primary cardiologist
regarding the risks and benefits of aortic valve replacement.

On [**2-16**], the patient became hypotensive to SBPs to
60s-70s after getting into a chair after breakfast. He was given
1L NS with no response in BP. The patient was mentating but
became short of breath with IVF. He had worsening EKG changes.
He was started on Levophed without improvement in his blood
pressure. He was brought to the catherization laboratory for
potential emergent aortic valvuloplasty and was intubated. At
that point, he suffered a PEA arrest and could not be
resuscitated. He was pronounced deceased at 12:33pm.

# Pump: As above. The patient had severe pulmonary edema with
initial exam revealing crackles throughout his lung fields. He
was treated with a Lasix drip which was transitioned on [**2-16**] to
po Lasix 80 mg po twice daily.

# Rhythm: Patient was in NSR on admission. On HD #2, he had
chest pain, then went into PEA arrest as described above.
Telemetry showed atrial fibrillation prior to the event. In the
CCU, he was started on amiodarone 400 mg po tid to be tapered
over the subsequent weeks.

# Acute renal failure: Renal function initially declined
(creatinine to 2.1), then improved on Lasix gtt, but stayed 1.7
- 1.9 (above baseline of 1.3).

# Hematuria: He had hematuria (no clots) after traumatic Foley
placement at the outside hospital. The catheter was removed on
[**2-16**] with gradual resolution of hematuria.

# Diabetes: Due to acute renal failre, metformin was
discontinued and the patient was maintained on a Humalog sliding
scale with 30 units of Lantus at bedtime.

# Hematoma. The patient developed a small hematoma at the site
of his right internal jugular venous access after catheter
removal. This was treated with local compression.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo f w/ h/o CRI, htn, h/o nephrotic syndrome, w/ diarrhea,
c.diff pos at rehab, failure to respond to flagyl, w/ elev wbc,
and negative ct. A brief-problem based hospital course is
outlined below.

1) presumed c.diff infxn- Admitted and started on p.o. vancomyin
and IV metronidazole, w/ addition of levofloxacin for broad
spectrum coverage given recent abd surgery. Cholestyramine was
initially given for toxin binding. WBC was 30 on admission and
trended down with ABX; however, C.diff toxin neg x5, so
diagnosis remains presumptive.  C. diff B toxin was sent and was
negative as well. She completed a 3 week course of PO vanco and
IV flagyl antibiotics, which was completed on [**5-14**]. She
subsequently remained afebrile without further diarrhea, and was
able to tolerate PO's.

2) [**Name (NI) 1866**] Pt began having episodes of BRBPR on [**4-25**] with
resultant slow HCT drop. GI and surgery were consulted. Pt had
no abdominal pain, but given recent surgery and low albumin, we
were concerned that the bleed may be evidence of ischemic bowel
or dehiscence. Pt was also having intermittent episodes of
tachycardia, raising the possibility that she was having embolic
phenomena with acute ischemia. However, she had no abdominal
pain to suggest this. Colonoscopy was done on [**4-30**], showing
severe c dif vs. ischemic bowel. Surgery found that pt was not
surgical candidate and believed her bleeding and mucosal damage
was [**2-29**] c dif and would continue to improve. Biopsy results
showed no evidence of c.dif, but given pt's tenuous status, po
vanco and iv flagyl were continued while awaiting toxin B. It is
quite possible that the mucosal changes seen on colonoscopy were
the result of C dif infxn, which had been treated w/ABX and
resolved, leaving the mucosae to heal. As well, GI felt there
may be a superimposed ischemic insult. No further work-up was
performed since she had good clinical resolution of her colitis,
following completion of cdiff treatment.

2) acute renal failure w/ CRI-  Renal team was consulted on
admisison.  Baseline cr is approx 2.0.  On admission this was
significantly elevated to 4.1.  FENA was c/w prerenal etiology
and patient had R IJ placed in ED, started on NS for volume
resusciation.  This was undertaken slowly given that pt had an
albumin of 1.4 and pleural effusions were noted on CT.  Fluids
were changed to 1/2NS w/ bicarb on HD2. Cr trended down each day
and the patient has maintained oxygenation.   Alb/cr ratio not
c/w nephrotic range proteinuria- thus it was felt that the low
alb was likely multifactorial. Pt initially required boluses of
500cc NS to maintain Uop ~20-30cc/hr. With hydration and
improvement in her diarrhea, her Cr steadily decreased and
returned to baseline of 1.6. She was seen by renal who felt that
her increase in creatinine may have been secondary to
ATN/hypotension and recommended avoiding aggressive
overdiuresis. She did subsequently require aggressive diuresis
given her rapid afib/chf with lasix and niseritide drips.
However her creatinine remained at baseline of 1.7-2.0 with
diuresis. She did develop a transient metabolic alkalosis, which
was felt likely from volume contraction alkalosis. Therefore her
lasix was weaned to 40mg daily and her bicarb trended back down
to 30. Her creatinine was stable at 1.6 at the time of
discharge.

3) [**Name (NI) 1867**] Pt was noted to be mildly thrombocytopenic
on admisison.   Unclear why it was low when patient presented.
Most likely [**2-29**] extreme inflammatory/SIRS response (given elev
lactate on admission). Her PLT count dropped to 95 and DIC
workup and HIT Ab were sent, both negative. Her PLT count rose
as her clinical condition improved and remained in normal range
for the duration of her hosital course.

4) HTN - Pt's baseline SBP is in the 180s-200s range. On
admission, BP was low [**2-29**] 3rd spacing and early sepsis. Her BP
responded to fluids and she remained relatively normotensive.
She was continued on metoprolol for HR/BP control and
isordil/hydral was added for afterload reduction.

5) CHF - Evidence of CHF on initial CXR. Her EF was found to be
40% (previously normal), bringing up concern for ischemic event
precipitating her failure. In support of this she was noted to
have wall motion abnormalities on ECHO with inferoseptal/basal
hypokinesis. Diagnostic catheritization was not performed due to
her renal insufficiency and decompensated CHF. She was managed
medically, and on [**5-10**] the CHF service was consulted for
management. She was initiated on aggressive diuresis with IV
lasix for goal -1.5L per day. She was transferred to the CCU
briefly on [**5-12**] for more tailored therapy and diuresis for her
CHF (lasix boluses and nesiritide) with good effect (negative
approximately 500 cc overnight). She was transferred back to the
floor on lasix boluses.

Due to continued evidence of volume overload she was given 160mg
IV [**Month/Year (2) 1868**] + started on lasix drip at 10mg/hr. Then started
nesiritide [**Month/Year (2) 1868**] (1mcg/kg) followed by gtt at 0.01mcg/kg/min.
Diuresed well to this and maintained BP well, however after
increasing natrecor to 0.015, went back into rapid afib. Stopped
natrecor on [**5-17**]. Stopped lasix gtt on [**5-18**] given persistent
good diuresis. Now tapered down to 40mg daily lasix/day +
afterload reduction w/ Isordil/Hydral on [**5-22**]. At the time of
discharge, she was felt to be euvolemic with goal of matching
ins and outs daily. We will continue her on this regimen upon
discharge.

7.  Atrial fibrillation: Initially converted from RAF by medical
cardioversion performed with procainamide gtt in the CCU at
13mg/kg/hr x10min load followed by 2mg/hr for 2h trial. Became
hypotensive to 60's systolic, but subsequently recovered. Then
again went into RAF on [**5-17**] early am. Initially HR controlled w/
IV lopressor/IV dilt. Then [**Hospital 1869**] medical cardioversion w/
procainamide. Became hypotensive to 70's systolic after about 10
minutes on procainamide [**Last Name (LF) 1868**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] this was stopped and her blood
pressures normalized. She then converted 10 min later to NSR.
She has been in NSR the remainder of her hospital course. She is
not on coumadin due to risk for bleed. In addition, amiodorone
was discussed as a medical option for continued rythm control.
However, given the side effect profile, the family and patient
were more comfortable with holding off on adding amiodorone at
this time. They understand that there is a higher risk of
conversion back to atrial fibrillation and increased risk for
stroke without amiodorone.  We will continue rate control with
metoprolol as mentioned at 25mg TID, and may titrate up as
needed to maintain HR <80.

8. CAD- wall motion abnormalities on ECHO w/ inferoseptal/basal
HK. currently chest pain free. continuing with medical
management. On statin/b-blocker. No plan for cath at this time
given her renal insuff/co-morbiditites. Also holding off on
aspirin currently given her bleed risk. This will be
re-addressed as an outpatient through her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

9. Anemia- Initially had episode of GI bleed with blood loss
anemia requiring 3 units of packed red blood cells. Hematocrit
subsequently normalized. However, she subsequently was noted to
have a low, but stable, hematocrit at 28-29. Repeat stool
guaiacs were all negative and she had no further evidence of
bleed or hemolysis. Iron stores were also found to be within
normal limits, with low TIBC and high ferritin suggesting anemia
of chronic disease. This was felt likely secondary to chronic
renal insufficiency. She was started on EPO 2,000 Units q m,w,fr
on [**5-22**]. The goal transfusion criteria would be 30 given her
history of CAD, however, we have held off on further transfusion
at this time given her known CHF with recent severe volume
overload. We have set transfusion goal at hct>28, and transfused
with 1 unit packed red blood cells and 20mg IV lasix for hct
<28.

10. tachypnea- Resolved. Her transient tachypnea was felt likely
secondary to volume overload. There was no evidence of
infiltrate by CXR. Her ABG at the time on [**5-15**] showed
7.29/43/99. Her respiratory status subsequently improved that
same day on [**5-15**] following IV lasix and atrovent nebulizers.
Avoided albuterol nebulizers over concern for tachycardia.

11. F/E/N- Started on TPN for nutritional supplementation. She
also had a swallow study which showed ability to tolerated
regular solids and thin liquids. She has been taking in PO's as
tolerated, but has continued to require TPN to reach nutritional
goals. This will be continued upon discharge at rehab.

Pericardial fluid: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
.
ECHO ([**2203-11-3**]) Pre-pericardiocentesis: The left atrium is
elongated. The estimated right atrial pressure is >20 mmHg. The
left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The right ventricular cavity
is moderately dilated. There is a large circumferential
pericardial effusion. Stranding is visualized within the
pericardial space c/w some organization. There is left atrial
diastolic collapse. There is right ventricular diastolic
collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade
physiology. There is significant, accentuated respiratory
variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with
impaired ventricular filling.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2203-10-20**],
large pericardial effusion with echocardiographic signs of
tamponade is new.
.
ECHO ([**2203-11-3**]) Post pericardiocentesis: The left atrium is
elongated. The right atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity
is markedly dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is
normal. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely
more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is partial flail of a tricuspid valve leaflet. The tricuspid
valve leaflets fail to fully coapt. Severe [4+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2203-11-3**],
the residue pericardial effusion is minimal.
.
Cardiac catherization ([**2203-11-3**]):
1. Large circumferential pericardial effusion with tamponade
physiology.
2. Successful pericardiocentesis with drainage of 1500mls of
blood
stained fluid. Patient left cathlab in stable condition
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe pericardial tamponade.
2. Mild primary pulmonary hypertension.
3. Successful pericardiocentesis with drainage of 1500ml of
blood
stained fluid.
.
ECHO ([**2203-11-4**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Transmitral and
tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a
normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The
right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function is borderline normal [intrinsic
function is likely depressed given the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation.]. There is abnormal diastolic septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume
overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened and appear shortened/remnants that do not fully
coapt. A small echodensity is seen on the right atrial side of
the septal leaflet - ?vegetation ?old vs. partial flail of
leaflet segment. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is a small (<1cm), circumferential, partially echo filled
pericardial effusion without evidence of hemodynamic compromise.

Compared with the prior study (post-pericardiocentesis, images
reviewed) of [**2203-11-3**], the findings are similar.
.
ECHO ([**2203-11-5**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic
function (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline
normal. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened and appear shortened/remnants and fail to fully
coapt. A small echodensity is again seen on the right atrial
side of the septal leaflet which could be either a vegeateion or
a partial leaflet segment. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation
is seen. There is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion is
echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other
cellular elements. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2203-11-4**],
the pericardial effusion is slightly smaller and may be more
echo dense. The left ventricular cavity size is probably
slightly larger (reflecting better filling). The small
echodensity on the tricuspid leaflet has not changed in size.
.
ECHO ([**2203-11-8**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The
right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is normal. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of
tricuspid regurgitation.] There is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets fail to fully coapt.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2203-11-5**],
pericardial effusion now appears slightly smaller.
.
ECHO ([**2203-11-11**]):
The right atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is
borderline normal. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
tricuspid valve leaflets fail to fully coapt. There is a very
small, partially echo filled pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2203-11-8**],
the findings are similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
41 year old male with HIV/AIDS, previous R-sided endocarditis
and severe TR, presented in cardiac tamponade from
rehabilitation.

CARDIAC TAMPONADE:  On admission, he was transferred to the
cardiac catherization lab, where over one liter of fluid was
drained from his pericardial space.  The fluid was sent for gram
stain, culture, AFB, [**Doctor First Name **], TB PCR as well as viral studies and
cytology.  A pericardial drain was initially left in place, but
given minimal drainage over 24 hours, was pulled prior to his
transfer to the floor.  The etiology of the pericardial effusion
is unknown.  He was followed by Cardiology on the floor and the
initial plan was for a pericardial window, for both tissue and
to prevent reaccumulation of fluid.  The patient refused the
procedure at this time.  He will follow up as an outpatient to
re-evaluate for the procedure.  The effusion was followed by
serial ECHO while the patient was in the hospital.  There was no
evidence of re-accumulation.  He is scheduled for an outpatient
ECHO in several weeks to evaluate the pericardial space for
reaccumlation of effusion.

ATRIAL FIBRILLATION/FLUTTER: Per multiple EKGs, the patient
appears to have developed new a fib/flutter.  Given his guaiac
positive stools, it is not advisable to start anticoagulation at
this time.  The patient is being rate controlled on a low dose
of beta-blocker, which appears to be effective.  He will be
followed by outpatient Cardiology.

ANEMIA: The patient had a hematocrit drop during this admission.
 His lab studies are consistent with anemia of chronic disease,
however, the patient was found to have guaiac positive stools.
GI was consulted and recommeded colonoscopy and EGD.  The
patient was unable to tolerate the prep and thus the colonoscopy
was cancelled.  His EGD demonstrated gastritis and thrush.  He
was started on fluconazole to treat the thrush.  He was also
transfused two units of packed red blood cells with an
appropriate hematocrit response.

HIV/AIDS:  The patient had a CD4 count checked during his last
admission, it was found to be 132 with a viral load >100K.
Given his past noncompliance with HAART therapy and the risk of
developing drug resistant HIV,  HAART was not restarted.  Pt is
willing to restart HARRT, and the plan remains to restart
medications at rehabilitation.  Bactrim was continued for PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].

OSTEOMYELITIS:  The patient was previously admitted for left
ankle pain.  He was followed previously by both the orthopedic
and ID services.  Both services continued to follow the patient
on this admission.  The patient was continued on 6 weeks of IV
antibiotics (last day of cefazolin [**2203-12-5**]), although the dose
was decreased to 1g q6 because of a low white blood count.

SEVERE TRICUSPID REGURGITATION: Pt with known grade 4 TR and
flail leaflet which he deveoped after acute bacterial
endocarditis roughly 10 years ago.  We restarted his lasix and
spironolactone on this admission.

HCV: HCV viral load checked, and found to be 1.5 million.  No
further therapy initiated.

ANXIETY: Pt with history of anxiety and on Klonapin at home.
His home regimen was continued.

ESOPHAGEAL CANDIDIASIS: Patient was found to have thrush on EGD.
 He was started on a course of fluconazole given his
immunosupressed state.  He is being discharged to complete a two
week course of anti-fungal medication.

Chief Complaint:
SOB, decreased urine

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hemodialysis

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2251**] is a 70yoF with h/o dilated cardiomyopathy [**1-1**]
aortic outflow obstruction, AICD s/p VT, CAD, COPD (on home O2)
who presented with decreased UO and SOB, now transferred from
medicine service to CCU for hypotension. Pt is currently
somnolent and unable to provide a detailed history, so details
are obtained from OMR and Atrius records.  Pt saw NP in complex
care clinic on [**7-10**], at that time felt well overall, c/o dry
cough but denied SOB, peripheral edema. At that time her weight
was recorded at 185 lbs (dry weight is estimated at 184 lbs). On
[**7-17**] she called the CCC office c/o minimal urine output (""only
drops"") and cough productive of yellow sputum.  She reported
compliance with her home diuretic regimen, but [**Name8 (MD) **] NP note she
had not filled her aldactone rx.
.
On DOA, she called EMS due to increasing SOB.  When EMS arrived
her SBP was 80.  She received 250cc NS and was brought to ED.
In ED she had SBP 90s so received another 500cc NS bolus. CXR
showed no e/o infiltrate but she was treated empirically for CAP
with 1g ceftriaxone given her recent productive cough. Labs were
significant for Na 121 and Cr 5.4 (baseline 3.5-4.0). She was
admitted to medicine service.  On the floor, her BP was
initially 98/65 but then decreased to SBP 70s.  She was
transferred to CCU for pressor support.
.
On transfer, vitals were T 95.7, HR 60 (v-paced), BP 110/56, RR
18, O2sat 100% on 2LNC.  She was drowsy, but denied current SOB,
chest pain, palpitations, LE swelling.  She endorsed orthopnea
(c/w baseline) cough productive of yellow sputum, nausea, RUQ
discomfort, and anuria. Denied recent fevers/chills,
diarrhea/constipation, melena/hematochezia, BRBPR.
.
Of note she was admitted 1 month ago (from [**Date range (1) 2266**]) for CHF
exacerbation and hypervolemia. She was started on a lasix drip
with metolazone but was ultimately started on ultrafiltration
with a tunneled HD line which she tolerated well. She has not
required outpatient HD since discharge.

Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Admission
70yoF with h/o dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 35%), AICD p/w SOB and
poor urine output for several days found to have hyponatremia,
now transferred from medicine to CCU due to hypotension.
.
Active Issues:
.
#Acute on chronic systolic heart failure:  The patient was
hypervolemic on exam with elevated JVP and increased abdominal
distension at presentation.  Given the patient had been
refractory to diuretic therapy requiring ultrafiltration during
her last hospitalization and was oliguric and hyponatremic on
admission, ultrafiltration was initiated rather than diuretic
therapy. She experienced significant muscle cramping and
hypotension while on CVVHD requiring dopamine. CVVHD was
discontinued on HD#2 and she was diuresed with IV lasix and
metolazone. Pressures improved and she was weaned off of
dopamine.  It was noted that urine and blood pressure improved
when the patient was in her native sinus rhythm with
asynchronous ventricular pacing.  Therefore the patients
pacemaker escape rate was lowered to allow for increased native
rhythm and the mode was changed to AAIR.  Despite this change
urine output remained poor and she was therefore started on a
lasix drip ultimately requiring milrinone to augment diuresis.
On HD#6 patient underwent placement of a tunneled dialysis
catheter, and on HD#7 she continued HD using the tunneled line
(see below). Lasix and metolazone were discontinued as patient
will be HD dependent.
.
#Hypotension:  Patient was hypotensive on admission in the
setting of volume overload.  Her hypotension was believed to be
due to worsening cardiac output in setting of dilated
cardiomyopathy. She was temporarily on a dopamine gtt, but this
was weaned by HD#2.  In addition, she experienced episodes of
hypotension with CVVH with diuresis and antihypertensive
medications, so her antihypertensive medications were held. On
discharge, her BP was stable.  She was asked to continue to hold
her carvedilol and to follow up with her PCP about restarting as
tolerated.
.
# Hyponatremia: Pts sodium was 119 on admission and likely cause
of her AMS, thought to be hypervolemic hyponatremia with poor
renal perfusion given e/o volume overload on exam and low urine
Na. Her fluid intake was restricted to 1.5L daily, and she
started CVVH as above with improvement in her hyponatremia as
well as her mental status.  At the time of discharge her sodium
was 135.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient was noted to have a
creat of 5.4, baseline 3.5-4.0, and oliguria x 2-3 days on
admission. As stated above she had previously required
ultrafiltration during hospitalizations for heart failure
exacerbation.  Renal was consulted and felt that the patient
would require chronic HD.  Given her hypotension she was
initally started on CVVH with dopamine gtt for pressure support.
 However as above she did not tolerate CVVH and it was
discontinued.  She was diuresed with lasix gtt and milrinone as
above until she had her tunneled line placed on HD#6.  She
tolerated HD well, with stable BP and no muscle cramping.
Outpatient dialysis was arranged with [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) **] Dialysis
Center for mondays, wednesdays and fridays.
.
# Afib: Pt has a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin at
home.  On admission her coumadin was held in preparation for
placement of a tunneled dialysis catheter. As stated above her
pacemaker settings were changed and she was in sinus rhythm for
most of her CCU course with heart rates in the 50-70s.  Her mode
was changed to AAIR to allow for intrinsice AV conduction and
minimize ventricular pacing in an abnormal heart. Her coumadin
was restarted at her home dose on HD#7.  Her INR at the time of
discharge was 1.4.

# Stable issues:
.
# COPD: Patient's recent cough and SOB with h/o COPD was
initially c/f COPD exacerbation, and she was initially started
on prednisone and levofloxacin. However there was no wheezing on
exam therefore prednisone and antibiotics were discontinued. She
was continued on her home albuterol/ipratropium nebulizer
treatments, and maintained O2 sats >90% on 2L NC (her baseline
O2 requirement).
.
# CAD: Stable, no c/o chest pain during hospitalization.  She
was continued on her home ASA and pravastatin.
.
# HTN: Carvedilol was discontinued due to frequent episodes of
hypotension (with SBP 70s-80s).  She can resume as an outpatient
if BP tolerates.
.
# Gout: Patient was continued on her home allopurinol and did
not have any pain concerning for a gout flare.
.
# Transitional issues:
- Patient maintained full code status throughout
hospitalization.
- She will continue outpatient hemodialysis at [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) **]
Dialysis Center
- She has follow-up scheduled with her PCP and her cardiologist.
 She will be contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding a follow-up appointment with

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were in the
hospital.

You were admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath and
not making urine. Your heart was not pumping well which caused
you to have extra fluid.  We gave you medication to help you to
urinate out this fluid however your kidneys were not working
properly and you needed dialysis to do the job of your kidneys.
You got a special IV to be used for dialysis. You will need to
continue going to dialysis three times a week. Your blood
pressure was also so low so we did not give you your home blood
pressure medications while you were in the hospital.

You should continue to go to dialysis three times a week.  You
were also started on a medication called nephrocaps that you
will need to continue.

You should stop taking your carvedilol, metolazone,
spironolactone and lasix unless your doctor instructs you to
restart these medications.

Continue your coumadin and amiodarone for your abnormal heart
rhythm (atrial fibrillation).  Continue your aspirin and
pravastatin for your heart disease, your allopurinol for your
gout, your albuterol and ipratropium for your COPD.

Imaging:
[**2195-4-14**] LENI- IMPRESSION:  Limited examination due to patient
discomfort and extensive subcutaneous edema with no evidence of
deep venous thrombosis in the left common femoral, superficial
femoral, or popliteal veins.

[**2195-4-14**] CXR- Severe cardiomegaly has worsened, but pulmonary
edema has cleared.  Pleural effusion is small if any.  Right
supraclavicular dual-channel [**Month/Day/Year 2286**] catheter ends in the

or appreciable pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
71F with history of CHF, CAD, afib on coumadin, ESRD on HD and
COPD presenting with LLE cellulitis.
.
# Cellulitis - patient with chronic ulcers on left lower
extremity presented with inreased pain and erythema and elevated
WBC consistent with cellulitis.  She was recently treated for
cellulitis in that leg with vancomycin on previous
hospitalization in [**2194-1-28**]. After two days of vancomycin, she
had marked improvement in the leg with decreased erythema in
color and was dramatically receeding from the marked border
below the area. There was still [**12-1**]+pitting edema in the left
thigh, but improved compared to admission when it was harder and
was obscuring the anatomical markings of the knee on extension.
LENI of the leg was negative for DVT.  She was seen by vascular
surgery during this admission, who did not feel that surgery was
indicated and agreed with the proposed medical management.
-Vancomycin dosed with HD x 2 weeks (last day [**4-28**])
-Ciprofloxacin 500mg po qday x 2 weeks (last day [**4-28**])
.
#Hypotension - patient hypotensive to SBPs in 80s. In the ED
there was concern that she was possibly septic, so she was
admited to the ICU. She received 1.5L of IV fluids and her BP
repsonded well. Her baseline blood pressure is in the low 90s
systolic.  After being on the floor she continued to have lower
blood pressures and was asymptomatic with them.
-She will require monitoring of her blood pressure during
[**Month/Year (2) 2286**] sessions
.
# Afib - on amiodarone and coumadin as outpatient.  Stable.  INR
therapeutic at 2.1 on admission.  Continued on home medications
- cont warfarin and amiodarone
.
# CAD - Continued on amiodarone, pravastatin and SLNGT
.
# COPD - on spiriva, alubterol and fluticasone at home. Also
uses 2L NC at night at home. Has had cough for the past [**3-6**]
weeks and recently started on doxycycline on [**4-10**], which was
continued for planned 7 day course total and will be completed
on [**4-16**].  No worsening SOB.  CXR showed no evidence of PNA
.
# chronic sytolic CHF - Continued on home furosemide dose.
Patinet is not on ACEI prior to this admission, and this was not
started given her hypotension.
.
# ESRD - Continued on HD schedule of T-TH-SAT. She received an
extra ultrafiltration session on [**4-17**] (friday) to try to remove
more fluid from her left leg.

Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 2251**],
It was a pleasure taking care of you here at [**Hospital1 18**].  You were
admitted to the hospital because you were found to have an
infection of the skin on your left leg.  While you were in the
emergency room your blood pressure was on the lower side so you
were in the ICU for a night to make sure it didn't drop further
and it was stable (your blood pressure at baseline runs very low
and you were asymptomatic throughout your ICU stay). You were
then transferred to the regular medical floor where you were
stable.

You received [**Hospital1 2286**] on your regularly scheduled timing, and
received an extra session on Friday.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2130-2-3**] Mr. [**Known lastname 2302**] was admitted to the surgery service
under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with the diagnosis of a lower GI
bleed. His initial Hct was 28 and initial INR was 15. He was
admitted to the ICU and resuscitated. He was transfused 2 units
of PRBCs for a Hct of 22, and 2 units of FFP to reverse his
anticoagulation. He was also given Vitamin K. The following day
he was transfused 4 more units of PRBCs. The GI service was
consulted and 2 attempts were made to do a colonoscopy. Both
attempts were aborted due to a poor preparation. After 3 days in
the ICU, Mr. [**Known lastname 2303**] Hct was stable at 26-27. He was
transferred to the floor and given 1 more unit of PRBCs for
borderline urine output. His Hct then stabilized at 28-29. Since
he had no more episodes of bloody bowel movements, it was felt
that there was no need to make further attempts at colonoscopy.
His diet was then slowly advanced, physical therapy evaluated
the patient, and he was discharged to rehab on HD 7. He will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1940**] from GI as well as his PCP regarding
his coumadin dose and INR checks. At the time of discharge he
was placed on coumadin 1mg Qhs (h/o PE and cardiac thrombus) and
his INR was 1.4. His Hct was 28.7.

the previous

infarction. Clinical correlation is suggested.


Brief Hospital Course:
## Hematochezia/Crohn's: Likely [**1-12**] combination of known Crohn's
and overanticoagulation most likely due to drug interaction of
coumadin w/ sasacol. Received 2Units FFP and 1 unit PRBC + vit
K. With drop of Hct as low as 23.6, 27.0 upon d/c.  INR upon d/c
1.0.  Underwent colonoscopy showing ulcer in proximal ascending
colon which wx bx to exclude ulcerated neoplasia, chrohn's dz
which was bx, and pseudopolyps in the descending colon and
sigmoid colon.
.
## ARF: likely hypovolemia in setting of GIB, Cr of 1.6 from
baseline of 1.0. Currently back to baseline.
.
## Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: in sinus rhythm on [**Month/Day (2) 2304**].
- hold anticoag for now as risks outweigh benefits.  Will be
restarted w/ f/u w/ PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] control meds because of bleeding,
pt not in AF on [**Last Name (LF) 2304**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] restart BB w/ d/c to rehab facility.


## HTN: Meds held in setting of bleed, restarting OP meds w/ d/c
to rehab.  Holding lasix [**1-12**] to continued dehydration [**1-12**] to
poor PO intake.
.
## DCM: appears euvolemic
- hold furosemide in setting of GI bleed
.
## h/o PE, LV thrombus:
- hold anticoag in setting of GI bleed, will restart as
outpatient.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Lower GI Bleed


Discharge Condition:
Stable


Discharge Instructions:
  You are being discharged from the hospital after an admission
for a lower gastrointestinal bleed.  Because of significant
blood loss, you were stabilized throughout the admission with
transfusion of blood products and clotting proteins.  You
underwent colonoscopy to evaluate for source of the bleeding.
It not only showed multiple areas of sick colon consistent with
your Chron's disease, but also a non-bleeding ulcer in the
bowel.  Multiple biopsy's were taken, results pending.  The most
likely cause of your bleeding is your very low ability to clot
due to a reaction between your blood thinner coumadin and the
asacol which you started.  Both medications are being stopped,
and only restarted after discussion between your PCP and your
Gastroenterologist.
   After being evaluated by Physical Therapy, it is felt that
you would benefit from a short stay in an acute rehab facility

[**2131-7-10**]: ECHO
LA is normal in size. No ASD is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric LV hypertrophy. LV cavity is moderately
dilated. There is a sessile mural thrombus at the LV apex; the
clot is mural and not mobile. Overall LV systolic function is
moderately-to-severely depressed (LVEF= 30 %) secondary to
severe hypokinesis of the inferior, posterior, and lateral
walls, and extensive apical akinesis. There is no VSD. RV
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. AV leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but AS is not
present. Mild (1+) AR is seen. MV leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no MVP. Mild (1+) MR is seen. LV inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The estimated PA systolic pressure
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior report (images
unavailable for review) of [**2130-2-3**], a LV apical
thrombus is now present

[**2131-7-9**] Stress Test:
IMPRESSION: No significant ST-T wave changes in the setting of
baseline
ST-T wave abnormalities. No anginal-type symptoms. Nuclear
report sent
separately.

[**2131-7-9**] PMIBI:
IMPRESSION: 1. Abnormal study. 2. Severe, fixed perfusion defect
involving the inferior wall and the a large region at the apex.
3. Moderately dilated LV. 4. Akinetic apex and inferior wall
with LVEF 28%.

[**2131-7-9**] MRI Abdomen
IMPRESSION:
1. Hypodense flat subcapsular lesion within segment IV-B on
prior CT from [**2131-7-6**], demonstrates a slight delayed
enhancement; however gross stability since [**2129-4-9**] CT abdomen
and pelvis suggest a benign lesion. This lesion is amenable to
further evaluation by targeted ultrasound, possibly with biopsy,
as clinically indicated.
2. Vague 1.3 cm lesion in segment 7 on prior CT from [**2131-7-6**]
is not clearly visualized. However, this examination is motion
limited and a small lesion within this vicinity cannot entirely
be excluded.
3. Filling defect in the lower common bile duct suggests
choledocholithiasis without evidence of acute obstruction.

[**2131-7-6**] CT chest/abd/pelvis w/ w/o contrast
1) 3.7 cm irregular soft tissue mass at the lateral aspect of
the ascending colon, associated with lymph nodes, corresponding
to the colon cancer seen on colonoscopy. Small amount of fluid
along the right paracolic gutter, probably due to biopsy. 2)
Featureless appearance of the descending and sigmoid colon, with
increased wall thickening and fat stranding in the descending
colon, suggestive of active inflammation due to Crohn's disease.

3) Ill-defined 1.3 cm lesion in the segment 7 of the liver, for
which metastasis is suspected given the colon cancer. Further
evaluation by multiphasic MRI is recommended.
4) Unchanged nodular appearance of the left adrenal gland. The
finding can be evaluated at the time of MRI as well.
6) New bilateral pleural effusion.
7) Increased mucosal enhancement in the perianal region, with
probable perianal fistula on the right, new since prior study.
8) Multiple hypodense lesions in the kidney, unchanged since
prior study.

Brief Hospital Course:
70 y.o. male with hx of Crohn's disease, afib, dilated CMP, h/o
PE who presents after recent discharge for LGIB in setting of
supratherapeutic INR on the same day when colon biopsies were
found positive for Colon Cancer. Patient was admitted for
metastatic work-up and cardiology clearance prior to colonic
mass resection.
.
## Colon Cancer: CT abdomen with 3-4 cm mass in ascending colon
with enlarged LNs, biopsies positive for Ca. Pt had CT of torso
for staging, showing possible metastatic dz of a single nodule
in the liver. MRI w/ liver protocol performed, without lesion
suspicious for mets. Cardiology recommended addition of statin,
asa, heparin gtt prior to surgery. Pt at mod-high risk for
moderate risk surgery.
.
## Dilated CMP/Systolic dysfuction: monitoring strict I/Os,
remained euvolemic. Continue meds of Lisinopril and Atenolol.
Stress w/ no significant ST-T wave changes or anginal-type pain
in setting of stress on [**7-9**]. PMIBI with evidence of fixed
profusion deficit, severe apical [**Last Name (LF) 2307**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 28%. Cardiology
consulted. ECHO on [**7-10**] showed mural thrombus and apical
aneurysm. Restarted ASA and started simvastatin and Heparin gtt.
Pt to require long-term anticoagulation on discharge.
.
# Choledochololithiasis: Seen on MRI of the abdomen. Patient s/p
ERCP w/ sphinctorotmy on [**7-11**] without complication.
.
## Recent GI bleed/Anemia: Hematocrit is stable at 26-30. Pt
denies any grossly bloody stools. Given mural thrombus, on IV
heparin until colon resection.
[ ]will send stools for guiac and monitor hct daily.
.
## Crohn's Disease - Stable, primarily rectal involvement.
Patient on lidocaine jelly and prn tylenol #3 for rectal pain.
Currently on no treatment for Crohn's given colon ca diagnosis.

.
## Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: pt was discharged without
anticoagulation on last admission after being admitted with an
INR > 7. Benefits of anticoagution are outweighed by the risks
at this time.  To resume coumadin post-op.
.
## Benign essential HTN: Controlled on Atenolol and lisinopril
.
## h/o PE: anticoagulation with Heparin gtt
.
## FEN: Heart healthy diet, will replete lytes prn.

History of Present Illness:
57 yo F with PMHX of HTN who presents with shortness of breath x
7 days, worsening over the last 3 days. Patient reports that she
has been feeling weak over the last 3 weeks with an
unintentional 10 lb weight loss (of note over the last 2 months
she has lost 20lbs).  1 week ago she started feeling SOB with
exertion, and ""hot and cold"" but no fevers chills.  Then 3 days
ago she began to have a non-productive cough that left her
""gasping for air"", worse at night, with ""belly racing"", (which
appears to be belly breathing when pt demonstrates this).
Patient denies nausea, vomiting, chest pain, night sweats, but
does endorse a poor appetite. She reports that food has been
tasting bland over the last week and that she will only eat food
that's ""really tasty"" like [**Location (un) 86**] Market, but most of the time
she just has soup at home.  Of note, patient also reports that 2
weeks ago she had burning on urination for 7 days that went away
spontaneously.  She also reports that over the last 3 days she
has been having more watery stools than normal, but no more
frequent BM's than usual.  Patient attributed the loose stools
to her being ill ""it's what happens when I get sick.""
Today was seen by NP[**Company 2316**], found to have decreased breath
sounds throughout, HR of 120, O2 sat of 70%, increased to 84% on
2L, so was sent to the ED.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2190-2-11**] 10:44 AM
IMPRESSION: Diffuse hazy opacities within both lungs, without
evidence for volume overload. Findings are most concerning for a
diffuse infectious process, likely with atypical organisms. If
the patient is immunocompromised, PCP should be considered.


Brief Hospital Course:
On admission there was high index of suspicion for PCP given the
appearance on chest x-ray and a significant amount of
oropharyngeal thrush. Bronchoscopy with BAL on [**2190-2-12**] was
positive for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was presumptively started on Bactrim and
Prednisone treatment in the emergency department. She was
consented for HIV testing and it came back positive with a
viral load (VL) of 114,000 and a CD4 of 8. Her oxygenation was
tenuous initially requiring face mask with desaturation to the
high 70 with movement to the commode but she did not require
intubation. Over the course of her treatment she was transition
ed to face tent and eventually to 4-5 L of oxygen via nasal
cannula. Her overall oxygenation minimally improved very slowly
despite Bactrim with a prolonged steroid taper. She was finally
discharged home with O2 supplementation of [**3-2**] L to keep O2 sat
at 94 % at rest. Her hypoxia was related to the PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**].
For confirmation, she underwent CTA of the lung which was
negative for pulmonary embolism. The CT did show diffuse ground
glass opacities as well as lymphadenopathy without effusions
consistent with the diagnosis of PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 2321**] her exertional
hypoxia, she remained well with minimal symptoms (only mild
dyspnea with activity but no significant cough and no fever or
chest pain). Patient remained in the hospital for several extra
days hoping that her hypoxia will improve. It did remain stable
at the above level without any additional symptoms (4-5 L at
rest with O2 sat at 94 with decrease to 87-85 with activity.
Without oxygen, her O2 sat will decrease to 76 with activity).
In regards to the new diagnosis of AIDS(AIDS defining illness
and CD4 of 8), her toxoplasma IgG was positive. She was started
on azithromycin for [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis. ID was consulted and will
follow her closely as an outpatient ( 3 days after discharge).
HIV genotyping was sent and was pending at the time of
discharge. The patient has a history of hypertension and was
continued on home dose of Atenolol 50 mg daily.  BP was well
controlled despite holding amlodipine/chlorthalidone and these
were NOT restarted on discharge. She did have elevation of her
liver function tests on presentation. Work up included negative
hepatitis serologies and RUQ ultrasound (mild fatty
infiltration). LFTs abnormalities were related to PCP pneumonia,
fatty liver, or both. Blood AFB culture and HCV viral loads are
pending and will be followed by her ID. She was discharged home
without VNA, the latter would offer little help as she had no to
minimal symptoms. Total discharge time 56 minutes.

.
Scope ENT (on admission): Her glottic opening is about 4mm on
scope exam without symptoms including stridor or retraction.
.
CT neck with contrast ([**2105-4-16**]): Retropharyngeal fluid
collection spanning from C2/3 to C5/6 with extensive surrounding
edema and inflammation of the hypopharynx. The airway is
narrowed to 4mm at the level of the hyoid. Patent cervical
vasculature.
.
CXR ([**2105-4-17**]): As compared to the previous radiograph, there
is no relevant change. No pathologic mediastinal widening.
Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. Presence of minimal
pleural effusions cannot be excluded. No focal parenchymal
opacity suggesting pneumonia. No pulmonary edema.
.
CT neck and chest w/ contrast ([**2105-4-18**]):
1. Interval slight decrease of the retropharyngeal fluid
collection and
improved airway patency.
2. No evidence of Lemierre's disease or new abscess formation.

3. No evidence of extension of the fluid collection into the
mediastinum. No evidence of mediastinitis.
.
Chest CT ([**4-22**]): IMPRESSION:
1. Rapidly enlarging multiloculated right pleural effusion. This
could be due to empyema considering clinical suspicion for this
entity, but definitive diagnosis would require correlation with
thoracentesis results.
2. Small dependent left pleural effusion has also increased in
size since the prior study but does not have loculated
components.
3. Slight increase in size of pre- and sub-carinal lymph nodes
as well as right hilar nodes. These are likely reactive.
4. Ground-glass opacities in left upper lobe which are likely
infectious or inflammatory in etiology.
.
TTE ([**4-22**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
[**4-23**] CXR
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Evaluation of the patient with
complicated pleural
effusion.

Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison
to [**2105-4-21**].

There is interval increase in right pleural effusion, loculated,
better
appreciated on the prior radiograph but the change in size is
significant. No pneumothorax is seen. Left pleural effusion is
unchanged. Bibasal areas of atelectasis are noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
61 yo F with PMHX of HTN presenting with sore throat, neck pain,
and odynophagia found to have epiglottis and retrophargyneal
phlegmon.
.
#Epiglottis/retropharyngenal phlegmon: Diagnosed on CT neck and
by ENT scope. Symptoms consistent with this. The patient did
improve clinically with steroids, Ceftriaxone and clindamycin.
The patient's airway was closely monitored in the ICU and
underwent repeat ENT scoping on [**2105-4-18**] that showed ongoing
arytenoid edema but completely patent airway. Repeat CT neck and
chest with contrast, in the setting of ongoing posterior neck
pain and inspiration pain as well as worsening erythematous
lesion (see below), did not show Lemierre's or mediastinitis.
There was minimal interval improvement in the phlegmon
collection, however. Blood cultures from admission were positive
for GNRs, later grew out HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE. Planned for 14
day course from day of first negative culture. The patient
remained hemodynamically stable and re-evaluation by ENT in the
ICU showed improved of supraglottic swelling so she was
transfered to the floor. Repeat cultures were negative ???? HIV
was sent and was negative. Patient continued to be symptom free
on the floor and did not have any further airway complaints or
problems. She was treated symptomatically with cepacol lozenges
and was kept on a nicotine patch and received nebulizers PRN.
.
#Erythematous lesion: Patient developed a 3X3 inch erythematous
lesion on her anterior chest, 2 inches below cricoid and poorly
demarcated. The patient endorsed feeling warm and mildly tender
to palpation in this area with no pruritis. No
plaques/papules/bullae. The lesion was very blanching.
Dermatology was consulted on [**2105-4-18**] given spread of this
lesion to ~4X4 inches despite broadening to Vancomycin. Given
the timing of her antibiotics, this lesion was not felt due to
drug eruption, although a very early drug eruption can not be
ruled out. The erythema was felt most consistent with a toxic
exanthem, which is a vasodilation that occurs in patients with
bactermia (more often staph, strep). Supportive care was
provided. Derm followed patient while in house. by hospital day
4 the rash had significantly receeded. Derm did not feel
compelled to biopsy - they thought it was likely due to her
infectious process but did not represent a cellulitis. Her rash
improved later in her hospital course.
.
#Pneumonia and pleural effusion: She was noted to have
intermittent hypoxemia and R sided pleuritic chest pain on [**4-20**].
Medicine was consulted on [**4-22**], and in setting of new moderate
pleural effusions R>L on CXR, recommended chest CT, which showed
rapidly expanding and loculated effusion on R. She was then
transferred to medicine, and ID was consulted. Her antibiotics
were changed to ceftriaxone. Her pleural effusion was attempted
to be drained by IR, but they only withdrew 30 cc of fluid,
given loculation. Thoracic surgery was then involved and carried
out a VATS procedure which was uncomplicated and the patient was
transferred back to medicine.
.
#Hypertension: Blood pressures normal and intermittently high
(SBPs 150s) in-house. The patient's atenolol, lipitor were held
in the setting of epiglottis/retropharyngeal phlegmon but
restarted once she was able to tolerate POs. Atenolol was
initially started at half home dose 50mg, then back to her full
dose.However due to asymp. bradycardia into the 40's atenolol
was discontinued ad replaced with Chlorthalidone on [**4-25**].
.
# Intermittent bradycardia to 40s, asymptomatic: She was
monitored on telemetry with occasional intermittent bradycardia
to the 40s. her EKG was otherwise normal, without AVB. TTE was
done which showed no HD significant pericardial effusion,
abscess, or vegetations. Her bradycardia may have been due to
vagal tone in setting of pleural effusions and pleuritic pain.
.
# Lower extremity edema: She noted increased edema during this
admission. She had some baseline edema as a flight attendant but
only while standing for long durations. She had no JVD or HJR,
and TTE was normal.
.
#PPX: Heparin sq
#Full Code, confirmed.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 75 year old man who is a retired anethesiologist with
h/o CAD s/p CABG and ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF of 25% who
was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] following a hospital course
for gallstone pancreatitis and now re-presents from rehab for
fevers.  During last admission, he was transferred from OSH with
with fever and pancreatitis which was thought to be from
gallstones although there were no gallstones in the bile ducts,
just in the gallbladder itself.  CT scan done on admissionw as
consistent with severe pancreatitis.  ERCP was done on [**2198-4-6**],
with sphinceterotomy and CBD stent placed.  His post procedure
course was complicated by fevers and repeat CT abd shows
progression of severe pancreatitis with extensive
peripancreatitis fluid collection.  This was thought to be
either from PNA or from inflammation from his pancreatitis.  He
finished a course of azithro/ctx and a course of flagyl/cipro
and eventually he devefesced.  All cultures were negative.  He
was discharged to rehab.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 year old man with CAD s/p CABD and ischemic cardiomyopathy EF
25% who was recently admitted for gallstone pancreatitis, now
re-admitted from rehab for fevers.
.
# FEVERS: Likely source is from his pancreas.  On last
admission, he was febrile without an identified infectious
source and was thought to be from inflammatory response to
pancreatitis and peri-pancreatic fluid.  Currently with

================================================================
Surgery was then consulted and he went to the OR on [**4-24**] for his
Infected pancreatic necrosis, status post gallstone
pancreatitis. He had
1.  Exploratory laparotomy.
2.  Pancreatic debridement with wide drainage.
3.  Open cholecystectomy.
4.  Placement of a combined G/J tube (MIC tube).

Post-op he stayed in the ICU for 2 nights and was trasnfered to
the floor on POD 3.

GI/Abd: He was NPO with a NGT and IVF. The NGT was removed on
POD 2. His G-tube was left to gravity drainage.
His J-tube was capped and then trophic tubefeedings were started
on POD 2. His tubefeedings were advanced to a goal of Replete
with Fiber 3/4 strength at 80cc/hr.
He had 3 JP drains in place and these were draining thick, dark
fluid.
He continued to have high output from these drains.
He was started on sips on POD 5, he was advanced to clears on
POD 6.
JP amylase was checked on POD 7, once on a full liquid diet. His
JP Amylase was 27K, 34K, and 14K. He was made NPO due to his JP
amylase reported as high. He continued on the tubefeedings. A
grape juice test was positive for a leak from around the JP
drains.
He had one small spot with minimal drainage that could be
expressed from his incision.
His is now having drainage around all his drains and g/j tube
with mild skin irritation. He has irritation around the tube
extending out from ~0.5 - 3 cm and appears at [**Doctor First Name **] to develop
yeast. His midline incision is c/i but has a small amount of
serous drainage on the gauze.

Have suggested using Criticaid anti fungal moisture barrier to
protect his skin from the drainage and to prevent the formation
of yeast. Continue to apply a thin layer of dressing around the
drains and change as needed do not allow the gauze to become
saturated with drainage. Apply the antifungal Criticaid two to
three times/day.


A CT was obtained on [**5-5**] and showed:
1. Heterogeneity in the region of the pancreas consistent with
the patient's previous necrotizing pancreatitis.
2. Three surgical drains in situ with some high attenuation in
the region of the lesser sac which may represent fistulization
from the small bowel into this residual collection.
3. Loculated fluid under the anterior abdominal wall measuring
16 cm.
4. Gastrojejunostomy in situ.
5. Renal cysts.
6. Bilateral pleural effusions.
7. Enlarged prostate at 8 cm.
.
He will remain NPO with TF for 2 weeks and then return for a
repeat CT. His drains will remain and the drainage will be
monitored.

Pain: He had good pain control with a PCA. He continued on a PCA
thru POD 6. Once back on a diet, he was ordered for PO pain meds
with good control.

Labs: We monitored his labs and his Tbili decreased from a high
of 2.6 on POD 2 to WNL by [**2198-4-28**].

Cards: He was being followed by his PCP/Cardiologist. He was put
back on his home meds on POD5, including Lasix IV for gentle
diuresis and his heart meds.

Renal: He was diuresing well and continued to have negative
fluid balance and losing weight appropriately.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal Discomfort

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP x 2
Endotracheal Intubation

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 85 year old woman with PMH of ESRD on HD, HTN,
and DM, who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**7-21**] with complaint of
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea x 3 days. The
patient also reported recent fever and chills.  In  the ED,
patient had a low grade temperature of 100.5 degrees.  Her
abdomen was slightly distended, with no rigidity or rebound.
Admission laboratory data were notable for WBC 6.2, elevated
transaminases, and INR 3.7.  Right upper quadrant ultrasound
disclosed a 5 mm gallstone in the neck of the gallbladder.
There was also a 5mm  gallstone in the common bile duct, without
ductal dilatation.  The patient was evaluated by surgery for her
choledocholithiasis.  The patient was also seen by the ERCP
fellow.  The patient was not acutely ill last night, so she was
admitted to the Medicine team, with plan for ERCP today. She was
kept NPO and was administered IVF overnight.
  This morning, she was administered 4 U FFP to reverse her INR.
 After receiving 2 U FFP, she became hypoxic, with O2 sats
dropping to the 70s.  She was placed on 100% NRB with
improvement in her O2 sats to the 90s. Prior to dialysis, she
was given 100 mg IV Lasix, with urine output (non measured).  At
1:50 PM, she was transferred to the Hemodialysis Unit for
initiation of hemodialysis.  Approximately 1 L was removed, yet
the patient remained in respiratory distress, with O2 sats in
the low 90s on NRB.  At 2:30 PM, a respiratory code was called
since patient's O2 sats dropped to 70s on the NRB.  The patient
was emergently intubated.  ABG prior to intubation was
7.21/55/55.  EKG disclosed new ST segment depressions in the
inferior and lateral leads.  Following intubation, the patient's
SBP dropped to 80s.  She was administered approximately 500 cc
NS bolus, and required Dopamine transiently.  The patient was
transferred to the MICU for further management.


Past Medical History:
1. End stage renal disease, on hemodialysis via RIJ tunnelled
portacath. h/o failed left arm fistula.

2. History of crescente glomerulonephritis by renal biopsy,
likely related to underlying vasculitis.

3. Vasculitis, ANCA positive, treated with chronic steroids.
Currently on steroid taper.

4. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

5. Steroid induced diabetes mellitus.

6. Chronic anemia related to end stage renal disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Respiratory Failure: On HD#2, the patient developed acute
respiratory distress.  The patient had recieved IVF in the ED
the nigtht before and that monring had recieved 4 units of FFP
for planned ERCP, the last two within one hour of respiratory
distress.  CXR demonstrated acute developement of bilateral
pulmonary infiltrates.  Ddx included cardiogenic pulmonary edema
versus TRALI.  The patient was taken for emergent HD; however,
depspite succesful diuresis, the patient required intubation for
respiratory failure.  TRALI work-up is pending at the time of
discharge.  The patient remained intubated in the MICU and
succesfully extubated on the second attempt.

2. Hypotension: After intubation, the patient became hypotensive
in the MICU requiring initiation of pressors.  She was found to
be adrenally insufficent by cortisyn stimulation test and
started on stress-dose hydrocortisone and fludircortisone.  In
addition, she required pressors and continued IV Unasyn for
possible sepsis, though blood cultures were negative.  The
patient's blood pressure improved and stablized.

3. Choledocholithasis: Demonstrated on admission RUQ US on
admission without transaminitis but with low-grade fever and
left-shift.  The patient was evaluted by Surgery and ERCP
service.  She was started on IV Unasyn.  Patient underwent ERCP
in MICU while intubated, which demonstrated dilated CBD but no
stones.  Patient had spinchterotomy.  The patient completed a 10
day course of IV Unsyn and will be discharged on two days.
Consideration should be given to possible outpatient
cholecystetomy.

4. GI Bleed: Post-ERCP, the patient dropped Hct and was foudn to
be guiac postitive.  Patient underwent repeat ERCP which
demonstrated spincterotomy bleed.  This required epiniephrine
injection.  Hct remained relatively stable, though she had a
possible rebleed several days later which stablized without
repeat scope.  ASA and coumadin were held [**2-3**] bleed and may be
safely restarted on [**2127-8-4**].  The patient's Hct remained stable
for the rest of her hospital course.  The patient will continue
on her PPI.

5. Coronary Artery Disease: During the patient's MICU stay, EKG
was noted to have
poor R wave progression.  An echocardiogram was obtained which
demonstrated regional LV dysfunction suggesting CAD.  Cardiac
enzymes demonstrated non-diagnostic elevated Tropnin T, felt
either secondary to demand or ESRD.  ASA was held [**2-3**] GI bleed
and the patient's beta-blocker was continued.  The patient will
need an outpatient evaluation of her coronaries, likely with ETT
MIBI when she is stable.  Again, ASA will be started [**2127-8-4**].

6. ESRD: The patient did well on her hemodilyasis schedule.  The
patient's prednisone was continued for her history of renal
vascultitis.

7. Hypothryoidism: Patient stable on levothyroxine.

History of Present Illness:
A [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with past medical history of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, Wegener's granulomatosis, recent
admission [**Date range (1) 2374**] for acute on chronic renal failure
with decision to initiate hemodialysis at that time and hospital
stay complicated by left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia
presenting with altered mental status.  Per her daughter, the
patient was home this past week and accidentally took trazodone
50 mg two days prior to admission, which had been discontinued
due to confusion.  Her confusion/visual hallucinations improved
the day prior to admission.  She complained of increased
productive cough and oxygen requirement (previously intermittent
2L NC, now continuous) over the past two days, responding to an
increase in nebulizer treatments.  The patient was noted to be
lethargic this afternoon, responsive to sternal rub.  When
aroused, she was oriented x 3 and moving all extremities well,
however.  The patient was noted to be ""cold.""  She has not
complained of recent fevers, chills, chest pain, abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, erythema around line.
.
In the ED, initial VS T 96, HR 63, BP 77/55, RR 18 SaO2 98%
(oxygen not documented).  Per report, patient had poor
respiratory effort, became apneic, and was subsequently
intubated.  Chest x-ray showed bilateral effusions and left
lower lobe pneumonia.  Head CT negative for acute process.  A
right femoral line was placed for access.  She was given
etomidate and roccuronium for intubation, vancomycin 1 gm IV x

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 46**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with past medical history of COPD,
Wegener's granulomatosis with resulting chronic kidney disease,
recent admission [**Date range (3) 2374**] for acute on chronic renal
failure, started on hemodialysis w/hospital stay c/b left lower
lobe Moraxella pneumonia admitted with recurrant moraxella
pneumonia and sepsis.

1)Moraxella pneumonia: Most likely explanation for respiratory
failure/hypotension in ED requiring intubation.  She was
successfully extubated on [**12-25**] and maintaining O2 sats on O2
via NC without e/o respiratory distress.  Her sputum culture
from [**2131-12-24**] is again growing Moraxella, no other new
organisms.  CXR continues to show same LLL infiltrate concerning
for partially treated pneumonia.  Concerning for endobronchial
lesion with postobstructive pneumonia however chest CT did not
show any underlying structural cause for recurrance of
pneumonia.  She did have bilateral pleural effusions which
appeared simple and did not appear to be parapneumonic.  She was
initially treated with vancomycin and zosyn however this was
changed to ceftriaxone once culture data returned with
moraxella.  She improved daily from a repiratory standpoint and
was on minimal to no oxygen on discharge.  She was changed to
cefpodoxime on discharge to be given only on hemodialysis days,
after dialysis as this antibiotic is renally cleared.

2)Altered mental status: Likely delirium in the setting of
infection, sedating meds, ICU stay especially in setting of
advanced age.  In addition, daughter reports that she took
trazodone two days prior to admission, which has caused
confusion in the past.  She had a CT head on admission without
acute process.  Her mental status cleared during her hospital
stay and treatment of pneumonia.

3)Coagulopathy: Her INR was 2 on admission, however climbed to
peak of 5.3 likley due to poor nutrition and antibiotics.  Her
coumadin was stopped [**12-25**] and held throughout the remainder of
her admission.  She was restarted on 1mg coumdain on discharge
with INR checks with dialysis. Her INR was 2.9 on the day of
discharge.

4)Chronic renal failure: Secondary to ANCA vasculitis. Decision
made to initiate HD last admission.  She was dialysed for volume
overload in the hospital and was dishcarged with plan for
dialysis at FMC - West Suburban Dialysis Center.  She was
continued on epogen with dialysis, nephrocaps, calcitriol,
calcium.

5)Anemia: Baseline mid-20s as of most recent [**12-10**] admission;
prior to that was in the low 30s. No signs or symptoms of active
bleeding, guaiac negative.   She was transfused one unit PRBC
with dialysis on [**12-26**] with stable hematocrit around 26
throughout the remainder of her hospitalization.  She should be
continued on epogen with dialysis.

6)Diarrhea - patient has developed diarrhea in setting of
multiple admissions and antibiotics.  She had one stool that was
negative for C. diff and was started on loperamide to decrease
stool output given skin breakdown.  She was also advised to eat
yogurt three times daily.  Diarrhea is most likely antibiotic
associated due to alteration of normal bowel flora, however she
will require two additional stool samples to rule out C.diff.
She will require monitoring of in's and out's and encouragement
for oral intake to prevent dehydration.

7)Skin Breakdown: During her admission she began developing skin
breakdown on her gluteal cleft likely due to a combination of
immobility due to acute illness and diarrhea as discussed above.
 She will require close monitoring of her skin and frequent
personal care to keep her buttocks clean and protected.

8)Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation:  Her metoprolol was initially
held in the ICU given sinus bradycardia and sepsis.  It was
resumed at home dose on [**12-26**] however given borderline blood
pressures, it was decreased to 75mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**12-27**].

9) Spiculated lesion on CT chest: as discussed in radiology
report, will need repeat CT in 3 months to reassess this lesion
for stability.

10)Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine

11)Code: Full

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with confusion, low blood
pressure and low oxygen most likely due to a serious pneumonia.
You were intubated and sent to the ICU for care.  You improved
and were able to be extubated the following day.  You were
treated with antibiotics for pneumonia and your breathing
improved.  You had blood cultures, urine cultures and stool
cultures which did not show any evidence of infection.

You had dialysis with fluid removal as you were given a large
amount of IV fluids on admission for your infection which caused
swelling in your arms and fluid around your lungs.

You developed diarrhea during your admission which is most
likely due to antibiotics.  You were started on loperamide to
attempt to decrease the diarrhea and to prevent further skin
breakdown.

Medications:
1)You will be discharged on cefpodoxime to complete a 2 week
course of antibiotics.  This should be taken only on dialysis
days, after your dialysis.
2)You can take loperamide as needed to decrease your diarrhea.
3)Your coumadin was held during your admission but can be
restarted on discharge as your INR was down to 2.9.
4)Your metoprolol was decreased to 75mg twice daily as your
blood pressure was borderline low.
No other changes were made to your medications.

Please follow up as below.

Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you have
any concerning symptoms including fevers, confusion, chest pain,
trouble breathing, low blood pressure or other worrisome

Cardiac catheterization
Blood transfusion

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2391**] is a 66-year-old male with hx HIV on HAART,
lymphoma, LUL lung adenocarcinoma s/p resection, hx CAD s/p PCI
with DES in [**5-17**] to proximal circumflex artery. In [**11-16**] he had
elective cath showing 90% restenosis at proximal edge of
previously placed stent, treated with overlapping Cyper stent.
Mid-RCA was 80% occluded and treated with DES as well. In [**2-18**]
pt had a left femoral artery to dorsalis pedis artery bypass
graft with an in situ greater saphenous vein graft. His plavix
was discontinued at that time. He was recently admitted on
[**2188-4-30**] w/ STEMI over III, F, taken to cath, where he had a DES
placed in the LCX for the vessel being occluded by a thrombus
proximally. Of note, at cath [**4-30**], he had a totally occluded
right external iliac artery. The pt was discharged home [**2188-5-3**].
Since that time, per the pt, he felt at baseline, with the
exception of intermittent left leg pain (s/p vascular surgery,
bypass) that would occasionally awaken him at night. He stated
he was up this morning at 4am b/c of this left leg pain, when he
developed a ""cold rough"" feeling in his esophagus similar to his
pain that he had with all of his prior MIs. He states it was a
[**5-24**] in severity. He took 1 nitro, and it resolved. He reports
he did not take his plavix yesterday and today. He noted
intermittent right sided chest pain as well last night, which
felt like ""gas pain"", + SOB, no diaphoresis, + nausea, no
vomiting. He states the feeling returned and then persisted,
took a 2nd nitro but it only decreased the pain to a [**2192-2-16**]. He
called 911.
.
In the ambulance, the pt's pain decr to [**1-25**] and he received
ASA, another nitro en route. His pain, however, only resolved
completely on nitro gtt at OSH where he was given ASA, IV
integrillin, IV heparin, started on nitro drip with full
resolution of pain, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent cath. His
initial BP at OSH 130/75, down to 93/63 after nitro. Outside
labs with CK 60, other ezymes pending at time of transfer, BNP
17.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], he was given plavix 600mg load prior to cath. In the
cath lab: LCX was totally occluded within proximal stents. A
wire was passed and flow was reestablished (likely development
of blood clots). 1 additional bare metal stent (no DES since he
had questionable compliance w/ plavix) placed distal to last
stent. Some non-occluding stenosis in the distal branches. Cath
was performed via radial artery (per lower ext arterial
disease). His right groin (femoral vein) developed a hematoma.
His left groin was not accessed given his c/o left leg pain post
surgery 2 months ago. He was subsequently transferred to the
floor. He then had BP drop to 90s/40s-50s and a pm HCT was found
to be 27.7 (6 point drop from pre-cath HCT). He is being
transferred to the CCU for unstable HCT and hematoma with labile
BP s/p catheterization today.
.
Brief CCU event: CT scan of abd neg for RP bleed. Neg groin for
psuedoaneurysm. Stable hct. Received total of 3 units of blood.
2 unit pRBC for hct 27 ([**5-9**]) -> 31.6 ([**5-10**] Am)-> 29.5-> 28.2

Brief Hospital Course:
66 year old male with HIV, CAD, recently admitted for STEMI
found to have 100% LCX lesion and stented w/ DES, who presented
with STEMI to OSH, and found to have total occlusion of proximal
LCX stent, now s/p bare metal stent placement. Pt was then found
to have a hematocrit drop and hypotension necessitating
transfuse to CCU, now stabilized.
.
Blood loss: Pt was s/p catheterization with R wrist for arterial
access and R groin for venous access. CT scan was performed, and
ruled out RP bleed and U/S ruled out AV fistula and
pseudoaneurysm. He received a total of 3 units PRBCs in CCU, and
his hct has been stable. Pt likely had blood loss during cath,
and in groin hematoma. After being transferred back to the floor
from the CCU, his Hct was stable. Low-dose metoprolol was
started the night before discharge, and he tolerated this with
SBP in the 100s to 110s.
.
Cardiac. Patient was admitted with a repeat STEMI secondary to
instent thrombosis. He had placement of a bare metal stent, and
was started on higher doses of plavix at 150 mg daily. He was
continued on aspirin and a high dose statin as well. His
antihypertensives were held due to hypotension, and restarted
prior to discharge.
He was not diuresed further, despite an elevated PCWP of 28 at
catheterization, due to hypotension. He remained in normal sinus
rhythm.
.
Hyperbilirubinemia: the pt was noted to have mild jaundice and
scleral icterus on [**5-12**]. LFTs were checked and his total
bilirubin was 6.6, direct bili was 0.2. His other LFTs were
normal. His hemolysis labs were normal. The hyperbilirubinemia
was felt to be most likely due to either reabsorption of the
large hematoma or a side effect from one of his HIV meds, most
likely atazanavir. His bilirubin continued to climb but he was
otherwise asymptomatic. A RUQ U/S showed small gallstones but no
evidence of cholecystitis or obstruction. His statin and HIV
meds were stopped on discharge.
.
HIV: Patient was continued on his outpatient HIV medications. He
was continued on prophylactic bactrim. He was continued on his
antidepressants.
.
Dispo. Patient was discharged to home with a stable hematocrit.

Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered Mental Status and hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F Russian-speaking h/o refractory nodular sclerosing Hodgkins
Lymphoma was brought in by EMS and admitted after her home
health care aide noted she was hypotensive to 88/40 and
confused.

In the ED, T 98.4 (rectal), HR 101, BP 102/53, RR 20, O2Sat 98%
on 3L. Incontinant of guaiac-positive stool.  Treated with 4 L
NS, vanco 1g IV, ceftazadime 1g IV, and flagyl 500mg IV.
Received 0.5 mg ativan and 2mg IV morphine for agitation.

Pt was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where she completed a 10-day course of
ceftazadime and vancomycin for urosepsis. A 7-day course of
metronidazole was also completed for empiric treatment of C.
Diff given loose stools in the setting of an elevated WBC count,
although all C. Diff assays were negative. Pt was stabilized and
was transferred to the floor for further care. At the time of
transfer, active issues were poor nutritional status,
thrombocytopenia and anemia.

On the floor, however, pt experienced an episode of new Afib
with RVR to 160s and hypotension to SBP 90-100s, as well as
respiratory distress after she received fluid resuscitation.
There was also a concern for tachy-brady syndrome because she
had pauses up to 4 sec on telemetry; EP curbside, however, felt
digoxin was not recommended.

Pt was therefore readmitted to the MICU.  While in the MICU, she
was started on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam as she had
(1) sites of possible infection at the erosions under her
breasts and on her right hip, as well as question of PNA, (2)
rising WBC, reaching a high of nearly 17.  MICU course was also
marked by (1) hypotension, which responded to gentle NS boluses;
(2) low UOP believed to be [**2-22**] both hypovolemia and a low
baseline nitrogenous load/obligate urine output; and (3)
recurrent Afib, for which she was transitioned to amiodarone
400mg PO daily, to run for 7 days before titrating downward.

Pertinent Results:
[**1-8**] - CXR - IMPRESSION: Persistent right-sided effusion. No
definite consolidation. Routine PA and lateral films are
recommended for evaluation when feasible.

[**1-10**].  Echo.
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (probably 3) are mildly thickened. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic
mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Based on [**2193**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2190-12-22**], there is no definite change.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]F with Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma initially
admitted for urosepsis, and who was transferred to the ICU with
hypotension and AFib with RVR.

# Goals of Care: The patient had a long hospital course with
many family meetings reagarding goals of care.  On [**2194-1-21**] the
patient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU
transfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the
patient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].
She was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a
decision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.
 Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].
The family declined autopsy.

# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to
150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous
conversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses
and bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin
considered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was
started on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When
the patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having
increased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.


# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and
thrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be
secondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused
total of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])
with a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend
platelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.
Transfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the
patient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total
of four units since [**2194-1-12**]).

# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having
hypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to
fluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV
relaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for
distributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was
started on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was
again hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary
to systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a
decision was then made to not escalate care.

# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious
sources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions
under breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz
started on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not
obtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff
neg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.

# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since
admission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been
getting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have
not been able to keep up her free water intake.

# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline
on admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to
infection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after
resolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.
Thyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick
euthyroid syndrome.

# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient
developed labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for
hypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide
gtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated
respiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a
witnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While
in the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had
increasing O2 requirements.

# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on
admission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of
0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due
to sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was
hypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought
secondary to ATN.

# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg
IV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home
dose 1/4.

# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural
effusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low
albumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.
Diuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed
above.  Continue to monitor.

# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis
requiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were
positive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin
and ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,
which was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew
out yeast.

# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right
acetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.
There is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head
secondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable
destruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and
surrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain
is being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.

# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to
agressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and
hypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese
in MICU due to development of hypotension in response to
furosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],
unchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.

# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no
interventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration
causing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic
count and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per
oncology.

# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.
Encourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 2469**] is a 68 y.o. man with PMH significant
for HTN and alcohol abuse, admitted for DOE and chest pressure.
Patient was ruled out for MI, but developed coffee ground emesis
while on heparin drip.  EGD showed severe esophagitis and
gastritis.
.
Upper GI bleed.  Patient developed coffee-ground emesis in ED in
setting of chronic heartburn and alcohol abuse while on heparin
drip.   EGD showed severe esophagitis and gastritis, likely due
to chronic alcohol use.  Hct fell to 32 from 42 on admission,
but patient did not require transfusions.  He was sent home on
PPI [**Hospital1 **]. Gastric biopsies for H. pylori were pending at time of
discharge.
.
Chest pressure/ SOB.  Patient presented with CP and SOB on
exertion.  He has no history of CAD.  He had a stress test one
year ago which was terminated early due to hypertension.
Cardiac enzymes were negative.  He was initally started on a
heparin drip in the ED due to concern for unstable angina, but
this was stopped when patient developed coffee ground emesis.
His antihypertensives were intially held, but resumed on
hospital day 2.  A lipid panel was checked and his LDL was in
the 40s.  He was advised to get outpatient stress test and PFTs.
 Patient has a significant smoking history and CSR showed
hyperinflation, suggesting that his DOE may be pulmonary in
origin.
.
Alcohol abuse.  Patient has history of alcoholism and quit
drinking for 20 years and now drinks daily.  He denies history
of DTs or seizure.  He was tremulous and required a CIWA scale.
He was given thiamine, folate, and multivitamin during his
hospitalization.
.
Transaminitis.  Patient had mildly elevated LFTs that were
thought to be due to alcohol hepatitis.  Hepatitis serologies
were sent, but were pending at time of discharge.

[**2-12**] RSV screen negative

Imaging:
[**2-12**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia. Right bundle-branch block. No
previous tracing available for comparison.

[**2-12**] CXR:
SINGLE FRONTAL PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: As compared to prior
study there is minimal increase in right mid - lower lung
opacity . Right lower lobe pleural thickening is grossly stable.
Bullous changes denoted by relative lucency in the right upper
lobe are again noted and unchanged. Prominent right mediastinal
- paratracheal soft tissue remains unchanged. Left lung is
clear. Heart is not enlarged. The aortic contour is grossly
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Minimal interval increase in opacification of the
right mid -
lower lung is better evaluated on subsequent CT from same day.

[**2-12**] CTA Chest:
1. No pulmonary embolus.
2. Right lung volume loss could be due to a congenital anomaly
or pulmonary infection early in life.
3. Persistent area of round atelectasis in the right lower lobe
with
increased size slightly since [**2166**].
4. New subpleural septal thickening in the left upper lobe and
medial basal left lower lobe, new since [**2166**] and suggestive of
an interstitial fibrosis.
5. Mildly enlarged 13-mm prevascular lymph node.

Given the pulmonary interstitial findings and mildly enlarged
lymph node,
followup high-resolution CT is suggested, preferrably in 3
months if not
needed earlier.

[**2-14**] Transthoracic echocardiogram:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
right atrial pressure is indeterminate. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size, and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
systolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure overload. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Right ventricular cavity
enlargement with free wall hypokinesis and moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic
function.
This constellation of findings is suggestive of a primary
pulmonary process, e.g., pulmonary embolism.

In the ED, initial vs were: T: 99.5 P109 BP101/56 R24 79% on RA
on presentation, 100% on NRB. Labs notable for WBC of 5, HCT
34.5, sodium of 131 and creatinine of 1.0. Patient was given
ceftriaxone and azithromycin, nebs, and methylprednisone.  He
had a CXR which was possibly suggestive of RML pneumonia, and a
CTA that showed no signs of PE but did reveal some increased
interstitial markings in the RUL and RLL, more consistent with a
chronic process vs. pneumonia. the patient was admitted to the
ICU for monitoring on [**2-12**]. He had in past refused CPAP for his
OSA but accepted it and reported he had an unusually restful
night. He was transferred to the medicine floor on [**2-13**].

#  Hypoxia: His increased cough and the CT and chest Xray
imaging were most consistent with a right middle lobe pneumonia
with underlying chronic pneumonic process, and he will need
another high-resolution chest CT in 3 months to evaluate
progression of these findings. In the ICU, he continued
antibiotic treatment for CAP. He did not receive further
steroids. He had an Echo that showed RV enlargement, free wall
hypokinesis & moderate elevation of PASP. Although these
findings were consistent with possible pulmonary embolism, he
had a CTA on admission that was negative for PE. Pulmonary was
consulted and felt his right heart findings could be related to
his underlying known chronic lung disease and sleep apnea rather
than PE. After discussion with his PCP and pulmonologist, he was
discharged to have a repeat sleep study performed and follow-up
TTE in 1 month.  Patient was encouraged to start using home
CPAP.

# Hyponatremia: He was noted to be mildly hyponatremic at
admission, possibly due to salt-wasting from his HCTZ use. This
mild hyponatremia resolved with a liter of normal saline.

# Obstructive sleep apnea: He is now agreeable to trialing CPAP.
He was told he should have an outpatient sleep study as above.

# Normocytic Anemia: His hematocrit was slightly lower than
recent baseline, and iron studies were consistent with chronic
inflammation.  This will be further worked up as an outpatient.

Discharge Instructions:
You came to the hospital with shortness of breath and fatigue.
You were briefly in the intensive care unit for close monitoring
and your breathing improved with antibiotics and steroids.  You
were found to have pneumonia and are being treated with
antibiotics.  You had an echocardiogram of your heart that
showed some strain on the right side of your heart, and this is
likely due to your lung disease.  Please follow-up with your PCP
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] and your pulmonologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as below.  You have
also been scheduled to see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] in sleep medicine to
discuss your sleep apnea.

The following changes were made to your medications:
Started levofloxacin, an antibiotic, once daily.  You should
take this for 4 more days.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow-up with your PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**], on [**2-21**] at 4:20pm.  You
should have another echocardiogram done in 1 month to evaluate
your heart function.

You have an appointment to see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**], a sleep physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
[**2-22**] at 8 AM, [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] building [**Location (un) **] to discuss your
sleep apnea. You should be fitted for a CPAP machine at home to
treat your obstructive sleep apnea.  If you need to reschedule,
you can call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 612**].

Please follow-up with Pulmonary (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**3-22**] at
8:45 AM on the [**Location (un) 436**] of the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] building, [**Location (un) 2476**].  If an earlier appointment is available, they will contact
you.  If you need to reschedule your appointment, please call
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 612**].

A CT of the chest showed subpleural septal thickening in the
left upper and medial basal lower lobes, new since [**2166**], and a
mildly enlarged 13-mm prevascular lymph node. Given these
findings, you should have a second high-resolution CT in the
next 3 months to determine whether these changes resolve on
their own.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 54M with hx of ETOH abuse, HCV, presenting
with AF with RVR, Chest Pain in the setting of ETOH
intoxication.
.
#: AF with RVR: Pt was in AF with RVR at presentation, which was
a new finding from prior EKGs. EKG showed no evidence of
ischemia. Pt was started on dilt gtt in ED and was transitioned
to PO metoprolol after arriving the ICU. HR was stable in 90s at
rest. Patient left AMA without waiting to receive his
prescriptions or cardiology follow-up. He was instructed to
return to the ED for palpitations, chest pain, SOB or any other
symptoms. He was instructed to follow up with his PCP.
.
# ETOH Intoxication: Pt presented with ETOH level of 412 and was
intoxicated. Lactate elevated but quickly trended down. He
received banana bag, and PO folate and thiamine. Electrolytes
were normal. Patient was monitored on CIWA scale in the ICU and
received Valium prn. SW was consulted. However, patient left
AMA. He stated he planned to take his home dose Campral and
continue attending AA meetings. He lives in a recovery home and
was instructed to have EMS notified if he experiences shaking,
confusion or any other symptoms.
.
#. Chest pain:
Pt presented with atypical chest pain in the setting of
intoxication that was reproducible on palpation. He denies
trauma but had been lifting heavy boxes recently. Pt evaluated
by Cards while in ED who felt that pain was non-cardiac. ASA
325mg and Nitroglycerin x1. One set of CE was significant for
elevated CK but normal troponin. DDx includes muscluoskeletal,
no evidence of PNA or ACS. PE unlikely given reproducibility.
.
# Anemia: Hct 30 on arrival. Near prior baseline. No evidence of
GI Bleed, no known prior hx of varies.
.
# HCV: Currently not receiving treatment. [**Hospital6 1597**],
records confirmed that Hep C antibody was confirmed to be
positive [**2143-6-2**]. HCV genotype was type IB, and RNA viral load
was
996,000 copies at that time.

History of Present Illness:
* interview conducted with the aid of Ms. [**Known lastname 1862**] daughter
.
History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 86 y/o F with
history of nephrotic CRI, renal artery stenosis, and CHF, who
presented with hypertensive emergency and heart failure. The
patient reports that she was in her usual state of health until
3 days prior to admission. At that time, her BP was 220 systolic
@ home and she noticed mild SOB. On the night prior to
admission, she developed increasing SOB. Per the patient's
daughter, she had been taking her medications as prescribed. She
denies chest pain throughout this time. She was brought in by
daughter to [**Name (NI) **] for evaluation and was found to have BP 202/40
with a K of 5.9. She was treated with kayexalate 30, lasix 40
IV, clonidine 0.3 mg PO X 1, and levoflox 750 mg IV x 1.
.
The patient was initially admitted to the floor, where she was
found to have the following vitals: 98.3 226/68 68 90% 5LNC (mid
80s on 2LNC), 96% on face tent, RR > 40. As she was acutely
dyspneic and in acute failure, she was given 100mg IV lasix and
Diuril (on the advice of Renal consultants), w/ good effect->
UOP 350cc in ~1hour. She did not receive any nitrates or
morphine at the time. On MICU evaluation was 99% on shovel mask,
but still RR>40. Appeared comfortable, JVP ~9 cm. At that time,
she denied HA, visual changes, CP, urinary changes, no abd pain,
N/V/D. In the MICU, she was aggressively diuresed and placed on
her usual blood pressure regimen. Overnight [**Date range (1) 1873**], she did
not receive all of her blood pressures meds as her BPs were in
the 110s/120s overnight. She did receive all doses of clonidine
and hydralazine on [**5-9**].
.
Her daughter tells me that her edema is less than usual, but
that her right leg is chronically larger than the left. She has
been using several pillows to sleep at home. She denies PND. She
is not on supplemental O2 at home. Generally BP at home is 170s
(per PCP 160s in office at baseline).
.
Pt was diagnosed with w/ RLL PNA by her PCP and tx [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/
levofloxacin X 10 days about 4 weeks ago. Since that time, the
daughter has been living with the pt X 3 weeks. Her cough has
persisted per the daughter, but the patient did improve greatly
following antibiotics.
.
At the present time, the patient says she is comfortable. She
denies chest pain. She continues to make adequate urine.

Pertinent Results:
Studies:
[**2194-5-8**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Moderate congestive heart failure,
worse since the exam of one month ago.
.
[**2194-5-8**] ECHO: TTE Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate
symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF 60%).
.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Moderate
(2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
.
There is severe mitral annular calcification. There is a
minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal mitral
stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**1-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
supporting structures of the tricuspid valve are
thickened/fibrotic.
.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
a small pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2193-9-19**], borderline mitral stenosis is now evident.
The mitral regurgitation, which is almost certainly
underestimated on this study, is probably increased.
.
[**2194-5-11**] CXR TWO VIEWS: Comparison with the previous study done
[**2194-5-9**]. There is interval improvement in interstitial pulmonary
edema. The mild pulmonary vascular congestion persists. Streaky
density at the lung bases is consistent with subsegmental
atelectasis. There is a moderate right pleural effusion and
small left pleural effusion. An underlying right basilar
consolidation cannot be excluded. The heart and mediastinal
structures are unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Interval improvement in congestive heart failure.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 86 year old female with probable endstage
renal failure not on HD, who presented with hypertensive
emergency and congestive heart failure.  She was admitted to the
medical floor but immediately was sent to the MICU for
respiratory distress. There she was agressively diuresed and
then returned to the medical floor.
.
* Hypertensive Emergency: Her HTN is likely secondary to her
ESRD.  The elevated blood pressures caused flash pulmonary edema
and congestive heart failure.  She was given blood pressure
medications to help control her BP within the range of 130-160
as she probably is dependent on some hypertension for perfusion.
 Her baseline BP is reportedly 160 at home.  Ultimately she was
placed on clonidine 0.2 mg TID, hydralazine 100mg TID, norvasc
10mg qday, metoprolol 12.5mg TID, lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
* ? SVT: During her initally presentation, she did have some
runs of SVT noted on telemetry.  Once she was diuresed no
further episodes were noted.  She was continued on metoprolol
12.5 mg TID for given episodes of ? SVT.
.
* Congestive Heart Failure: Likely from worsening renal failure
and hypertensive urgency. She was agressively diuresed in the
MICU with IV furosemide overnight and then with PO furosemide on
the medical floor. She was also continued on hydralazine for
afterload reduction.
.
* Renal Failure: A renal consult was obtained.  They felt that
there was no acute needs for dialysis at present although they
have been discussing starting HD with the patient and her family
for a while now.  This discussion was continued throughout the
admission and the patient and her family were resistent to
starting.  They agreed to meet with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1366**] in the next two
weeks to discuss getting a tunnelled cath and starting HD.
Throughout admission, her electrolytes were monitored closely as
she had boughts of hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia and acidosis.
 These were controlled with standard measures.
.
* Hyperkalemia: Received Kayexalate in ED. Usually takes
kayexalate twice a week as outpatient, so this was restarted as
an inpatient.
.
* Anemia: Baseline Hct appears to be 29-33 and now 25. Iron 45,
ferritin 149, TIBC 269 in [**3-5**]. Per renal recommendation, she
was transfused 1 unit PRBC on [**2194-5-12**] without complications.
.
* Bacteremia: WBC count 10 on admission and down to 6.4 today.
Has been afebrile but blood cultures showed 2/4 bottles with
staph coag negative- likely contaminant. Before speciation
returned, she was treated with vancomycin dosed by level. Once
it was found to be coag negative staph, the vancomycin was
discontinued. All subsequent surveillence cultures were
negative.
.
* Code status: Full - discussed w/ patient's daughter.

.
You were admitted with very high blood pressure and fluid
overload in your lungs. You were given medications to help lower
your blood pressure and get the fluid off.
.
Some of your medication doses have been changed. Please see the
medication list for those different doses.
.
As you know, your kidneys do not function very well. It has been
recommended that you start dialysis to help remove the toxins in
your blood which your kidneys can no longer remove.  You have
decided to hold off on this for now (despite knowing the risks
of sudden death, fluid overload), but you should follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1366**] to have this started soon.
.
You should continue to take your medications as prescribed.
.
You should contact your PCP or go to the emergency room if you
have fevers>101, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, weight
gain more than 3 lbs, or any other symptoms which are concerning
to you.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 86F with h/o colon cancer, ESRD on
hemodialysis, diastolic CHF, pulmonary hypertension, and prior
cephalic vein thrombosis who presented to the ED on [**8-15**] with
dyspnea.

The patient's dialysis catheter became dislodged [**8-12**].
Consequently she missed her normal dialysis session [**8-13**]. On
[**8-14**] she had a new tunneled catheter placed, but was not
dialyzed. The afternoon of [**8-14**] her daughter noticed that the
patient seemed increasingly dyspneic and was hypertensive to
200's. She was given hydralazine and clonidine and the BP
improved to 160's. She called her daughter ~3am on [**8-15**] due to
worsening dyspnea. The patient denies any accompanying headache,
vision changes, chest discomfort, palpitations, nausea,
vomiting, cough, weakness or loss of sensation. EMS was called,
and she was given CPAP with some relief of her dyspnea. Per her
daughter, similar symptoms have occurred 3 times in the past.

In the ED her vitals were BP 258/61 RR 28 O2 100% on CPAP, 89%
on room air (temperature was not recorded). She was started on a
nitroglycerin drip, and given calcium and bicarbonate for a
potassium of 7.1. She was weaned off NIPPV, with O2 saturation
of 97% on 3L NC. She was subsequently transferred to the ICU for
further monitoring and dialysis.

Past Medical History:
1) Hypertension
2) Stage V chronic kidney disease, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1366**].
3) Diastolic CHF (EF 60% on TTE in [**5-3**]), likely volume related
in the setting of her renal disease.
4) Rheumatic fever, with the following valvular abnormalities:
Mild aortic stenosis, moderate aortic regurgitation, mild mitral
stenosis, mild to moderate MR, mild TR.
5) Severe PA systolic hypertension
6) Renal artery stenosis:  MRI [**2185**] atrophic R kidney, moderate
stenosis of R renal artery, L renal artery normal.
7) Peripheral vascular disease:  Has claudication.
8) Right cephalic vein DVT in [**6-/2193**]
9) Colon cancer in [**2-/2192**], status post resection.
10) Hyperlipidemia
11) Right bundle branch block
12) Anemia of renal failure
13) Osteoarthritis
14) Osteopenia
15) Glaucoma

[**8-15**] CXR
FINDINGS:  AP view of the chest on upright position.  The
cardiac silhouette cannot be evaluated on this AP view.  The
right-sided central venous catheter is unchanged.  The left
costophrenic angle is blunted consistent with pleural effusions.
 Left lung base atelectasis are noted.  There is no evidence of
pneumothorax. There is a right lung base opacity obscuring the
right-side cardiac border which may represent right middle lobe
atelectasis vs. pneumonia. Pprominence of the pulmonary
vasculature is noted, consistent with mild CHF. The osseous
structures are unchanged.
  IMPRESSION:
1.  Right middle lobe atelectasis vs. pneumonia.
2.  Mild CHF with small left- sided pleural effusion.

[**8-15**] EKG
Sinus bradycardia at 56bpm, left axis, old RBBB, peaked T's that
are new compared to [**2194-6-24**] EKG. Inverted T in V3 on [**6-2**] EKG
has flipped to positive. No signs of acute ischemia.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Dyspnea - The patient's dyspnea was thought to be secondary
from volume overload, occuring in the context of ESRD and a
missed hemodialysis session, as well as hypertension leading to
flash pulmonary edema. Her dyspnea following hemodialysis.

2. Hypertension - The patient's hypertension is also likely
related to volume overload. Her blood pressures improved
following dialysis and resumption of her home course of toprol,
clonidine, amlodipine, and hydralazine.

3. Hyperkalemia - The patient's potassium normalized following
dialysis.

4. ESRD - Renal following, on dialysis MWF.

5. FEN - Continue sevelemer, nephrocaps.

CXR [**2198-7-17**]:
Semi-upright portable AP view of the chest obtained.
Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly with diffuse ground-glass
haziness throughout the lungs compatible with pulmonary edema.
The right hemidiaphragm remains somewhat elevated and overall
low lung volumes are noted which somewhat limit the evaluation.
There are no large pleural effusions and no sign of
pneumothorax. Hilar engorgement is compatible with congestive
heart failure.  Bony structures appear intact.
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema.

LHC [**2198-7-23**]:
1) Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system
demonstrated severe three vessel CAD. The LMCA was normal
without any
angiographically-apparent flow-limiting lesions. The stent in
the
proximal LAD had diffuse 60% in-stent restenosis. There was 80%
stenosis
throuhgout the proximal LCX, with a 60-70% stenosis at the
origin of the
OMB. The RCA had a 100% proximal stenosis with prominent
left-to-right
collaterals.
2) Resting hemodynamics showed elevated right and left-sided
filling
pressures with an RVEDP of 17 mmHg and an LVEDP of 27 mmHg. The
peak
gradient over the aortic valve was 14 mmHg. Using the Gorlin
equation,
the [**Location (un) 109**] was calculated to be 1.1 cm2, indicating moderate aortic

stenosis.
3) Left ventriculography was deferred.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate aortic stenosis.
3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
4. Needs diuresis prior to cardioversion.
5. Consideration for AVR-CABG.

LENI [**2198-7-24**]: negative for DVT

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient underwent the usual preoperative work-up.  Dental
examined the patient and recommended extraction of one tooth.
The patient refused.
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2198-7-25**] where
the patient underwent AVR (tissue), CABG x 3, resection of left
atrial appendage with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Overall the patient tolerated
the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the
CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
He does have a history of heart failure with an EF of 30% and
initially required multiple inotropes and vasopressors.  He
remained intubated due to pulmonary congestion, which improved
with diuresis.  Rapid a-fib developed and amiodarone drip was
initiated.  This was discontinued when rate was controlled.  He
failed a trial of Precedex.  He self-extubated and was
re-intubated without incident.  He developed a leukocytosis and
was started on cipro for a positive urinalysis.  There was no
growth on culture, and cipro was discontinued.  Tube feeds were
started on POD 3.  He was extubated on POD 4.  By this time, all
vasoactive drips had been weaned.  Coumadin was resumed for
chronic a-fib.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication.  Beta-blocker was initiated and the
patient was gently diuresed toward the pre-operative weight.
ACE Inhibitor was not initiated due to a rise in Creatinine,
which would start to trend down prior to discharge.  The patient
was evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance
with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD #10
the patient was ambulating freely, and pain was controlled with
oral analgesics. Due to upper and lower pole serosanguinous
sternal drainage, Mr.[**Known lastname 1884**] was placed on prophylactic
antibiotics x 1 week per Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **].  The patient was discharged  to
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation

History of Present Illness:
76yo F with PAF s/p recent TEE-DCCV on [**4-21**], HTN, admitted with
hypoxic respiratory failure.  She was recently hospitalized from
[**Date range (1) 1919**] for a supratherapeutic INR of 16.  She was in AF with
a ventricular rate of 110s-140s, asymptomatic.  Medical
management of her AF was initially tried.  She was maintained on
her atenolol and propafenone, and diltiazem was added.  The
decision was then made to pursue cardioversion instead.
TEE-DCCV was performed on [**2112-4-21**].  She was in sinus rhythm
after the procedure and had a HR in the 50s on atenolol and
propafenone upon discharge.  The diltiazem had been discontinued
secondary to bradycardia post-procedure.  She was also
discharged on Coumadin 1mg qhs.  Her family states her symptoms
began just prior to discharge, when she began to feel short of
breath and fatigued.  Her symptoms progressively worsened at
home.  She was seen in [**Company 191**] the next morning and was found to
have O2 sats in the 80s, so she was sent to the ED.
.
In the ED, her T was 100.6, HR 70s in NSR, and she was 84% on
4L.  Her CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions and vascular
engorgement, and her INR was 9.  She received a Combivent neb,
Lasix 20mg IV, levofloxacin 500mg IV, and vitamin K 5mg SC.  She
was intubated for hypoxia.  Repeat CXR showed improvement in
pulmonary edema after Lasix.  She was admitted to the CCU for
further management of hypoxia due to possible CHF.

Past Medical History:
1. Atrial fibrillation: diagnosed [**2102**], on propafenone x several
years, started Coumadin [**4-11**], s/p TEE-DCCV on [**4-21**]
2. Hypertension: on enalapril and atenolol

Social History:
No EtOH, no past or present smoking hx, no illicit drug use.
Lives with her husband in [**Name (NI) 86**], has 1 daughter. Used to work
in [**Country 532**] as an engineer. Moved to US from [**Country 532**] in [**2098**].

.
CXR: continued moderate-to-severe pulmonary interstitial edema
with bilateral pleural effusions, no evidence of pneumothorax
.
TEE ([**4-21**]): The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left
atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular cavity size, and systolic function are
normal. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch and
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-25**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Stress echo ([**9-25**]): Good functional exercise capacity. No ECG or
2D echocardiographic evidence of inducible ischemia to achieved
workload. Mildly blunted hemodynamic response to exercise. Mild
mitral regurgitation. Limited study. Target HR not achieved.

Brief Hospital Course:
.
# Dyspnea: Her shortness of breath and respiratory failure were
thought secondary to  pulmonary edema.  The pulmonary edema
likely followed an indolent course, with her rapid atrial
fibrillation and diastolic dysfunction causing progressive
volume overload.  Her acute exacerbation was likely due to
post-cardioversion pulmonary edema.  She initially had a
low-grade fever, but pneumonia was thought less likely, and her
chest x-ray was without infiltrate.  She had normal cardiac
enzymes, so ischemia was not a contributing factor.  She was
maintained on a beta blocker and ACE-inhibitor.  After
aggressive diuresis, she was weaned off mechanical ventilation
quickly.  Diuresis was continued with prn IV Lasix, and she had
resolution of her dyspnea and oxygen requirement.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: She was in sinus rhythm on admission, and
was initially maintained on propafenone and metoprolol.  On [**4-23**],
she converted to atrial fibrillation and had a rapid ventricular
response in the 140s.  She underwent DC cardioversion, after
which she became hypotensive and bradycardic, requiring
transient treatment with dopamine.  She was continued on
propafenone after the DCCV.  On the morning of [**4-26**], she
converted into atrial fibrillation again, with rates of 140s.
She had a normal blood pressure and some mild palpitations.  She
was initially loaded with po amiodarone, with slowing of her
heart rates to the 100s to 110s.  When her heart rate began to
trend up again, she was loaded with IV amiodarone and started on
a drip.  Her rates remained in the 100s to 110s.  She was
transitioned to po amiodarone on the night of [**4-26**].  She
experienced nausea and vomiting on po amiodarone.  She underwent
another cardioversion on [**4-29**] but reverted back to atrial
fibrillation the next day.  She was continued on amiodarone but
remained in atrial fibrillation.  She went into rapid
ventricular response in the 150s on [**5-1**], requiring IV diltiazem
to bring her rate down.  She was started on po diltiazem, which
was quickly titrated up with her heart rate decreasing to the
80s.  The diltiazem was stopped the morning of [**5-3**], just before
she underwent another cardioversion.  She remained in sinus
rhythm for the rest of her stay.  She was discharged on
amiodarone 200mg po three times daily, with a follow up
appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**].  Anticoagulation as below.
.
# Elevated INR:  INR went from 4 on [**4-21**] to 9 on [**4-22**] with only
1 mg of Coumadin.  Last admission was for INR of 16 on Coumadin
4mg qhs.  Received 5mg vitamin K SC in the ED.  Repeat coags on
the floor showed INR of 11, would have expected some decline
with SC vitamin K.  Her INR decreased to 4.5 with FFP.  Her INR
then decreased to normal.  Hematology was consulted and felt she
could potentially have a partial clotting factor deficiency
causing her severe sensitivity to Coumadin.  Her Coumadin was
held throughout most of her stay, and she was maintained on IV
heparin.  Coumadin was restarted at 0.5mg on [**5-3**] after her
cardioversion.  Her INR remained subtherapeutic after 2 doses.
She was discharged on Coumadin 0.5mg qhs with a Lovenox bridge,
with an INR check 4 days after discharge.  She is to follow up
with her PCP to consider Hematology follow up.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2190**] was admitted under the acute care surgery service on
[**2148-2-3**] for further evaluation and management of her injuries.
She was initially admitted to the trauma ICU for close
monitoring given her rib fractures, and was transferred to the
floor on HD#1 as she remained stable.

Neuro: She remained alert and oriented throughout her
hospitalization. Her pain level was routinely assessed. She was
initially administered IV narcotics for pain control, and was
transitioned to an oral regimen when tolerating PO's. Prior to
discharge, she reported adequate pain control on an oral
regimen.

CV: Her vital signs were monitored routinely and she remained
afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Serial hct's were checked
given her liver lac, initially q6h on admission and then [**Hospital1 **].
They remained stable, and she remained without evidence of blood
loss.

Pulm: Given the small size of her pneumothorax, no chest tube
placement was necessary. Agressive pulmonary toileting and
incentive spirometry were encouraged. Nebulizer treatments were
administered. Her supplemental oxygen was able to be weaned.
Prior to discharge, her oxygen saturation was within normal
limits on room air. She remained without respiratory compromise.

GI: She was initially kept NPO with IV fluids for hydration and
an NG tube was placed on admission given her liver laceration.
Her hematocrit remained stable and abdominal exam remained
benign, so the NG tube was removed on [**2-4**] and she was started on
clear liquids. Her diet was slowly advanced over the next 24
hours and she was tolerating a regular diet at discharge. She
was started on a bowel regimen given her narcotic intake.

GU: A foley catheter was placed on admission. Her intake and
output were closely monitored. On [**2-5**] it was removed and she
voided without difficulty.

Musk: Orthopedics was consulted given her pelvic fractures and
lumbar transverse process fractures. These injuries were
determined to be stable requiring no surgical intervention.
Follow up in the orthopedic clinic was scheduled for 2 weeks
from discharge.

Physical therapy was consulted to evaluate her mobility, given
her injuries determined she was best suited going to rehab. The
patient was discharged to rehab in stable condition, pain
controlled on oral medication, tolerating a regular diet, and
urinating without difficulty.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after being struck by a motor
vehicle.  As a result of this accident you sustained multiple
injuries as listed below.

Your multiple rib fractures can cause severe pain and
subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of the
pain.

*  You should take your pain medication as directed to stay
ahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep
breaths. If the pain medication is too sedating take half the
dose and notify your physician.

*  Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that
pool in the lungs.

*  You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to
hold against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing
and deep breathing.

*  Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short
periods may ease the pain.

*  Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid
and fiber intake if possible.

*  Do NOT smoke

*  If your doctor allows, non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin,
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side
effects so make sure your doctor approves.

*  Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation
around your ribs ( crepitus ).

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1928**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP with sphincterotomy and biliary stent placement on [**2157-2-1**]

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known firstname 1929**] [**Known lastname 1930**] is a very nice 85 year-old woman with a
history of cholecystectomy and ampullar stenosis who presents
with RUQ abdominal pain. She states her pain started 2 days
prior to admission, was constant and radiated towards the back.
She had nausea, vomit, malaise.  Denies fever, chills, changes
in her bowel movements, hematochezia or melena.  Unable able to
tolerate oral intake.

Presenting vitals were T 101.5, HR 68, BP 152/76, RR 16, SpO2
95% RA.  In ED, Unasyn 3gm given and a right IJ central line was
placed. She underwent ERCP that showed 1-cm stone in the common
bile duct. Patient became hypoxic from the conscious sedation,
so the stone was not removed to expedite the procedure. A
plastic biliary stent was successfully placed.  Post-ERCP, she
was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of cholangitis.

ICU course:  In the ICU, the patient was continued on Zosyn, her
RUQ pain significantly improved, and she began to tolerate
fluids.  On [**2-3**], she developed shortness of breath that
improved with administration of furosemide.  Nebulizer
treatments also given.  At time of transfer to floor, O2 sat was
95% on 2L nasal canula.  Lisinopril restarted, but Atenolol and
Nifedipine held for concern of lower heart rate.

She was transferred to the floor and felt improvement in her
abdominal pain.  Denied shortness of breath, chest pain.

1. Stable pneumobilia and proximal biliary dilatation.
2. Left adnexal lesion, 2.6 cm. Recommend ultrasound for further

characterization, and to exclude a solid lesion/cyst with mural
nodule in this postmenopausal woman.

ERCP [**2157-2-1**]:
Findings: Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal
Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal
Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal
Major Papilla: Evidence of a previous wide open sphincterotomy
was noted in the major papilla. Pus was noted at the ampulla.
Cannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and
deep using a free-hand technique. Contrast medium was injected
resulting in complete opacification.

Biliary Tree: A single 15 mm stone that was causing partial
obstruction was seen at the lower third of the common bile duct.
The bile duct was dilated to 15 mm. The rest of the biliary tree
was normal. Detailed cholangiogram was not obtained due to
suspicion of cholangitis.
Procedures: A 5cm by 10FR Double pig-tail biliary stent was
placed successfully.

Impression: S/P sphincterotomy - this was widely patent.
Pus noted at the ampulla.
Stone at the lower third of the common bile duct, dilation of
bile duct to 15 mm, other normal biliary tree.
A double pig-tail stent was placed in the bile duct.

Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum

TTE [**2-8**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
mitral valve. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation
is seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is
increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 year-old woman presents with cholangitis [**12-21**]
choledocholithiasis s/p ERCP with biliary stent placement.
Gallstone was not removed because of the patient's tenous
condition.  The plan will be to repeat the ERCP in one month to
remove the stone.  Patient was also with bacteremia with E. Coli
and Enterococcus likely [**12-21**] biliary source.  Patient initially
on Zosyn, but because of thrombocytopenia was changed over to
Vanco and Cipro.  This was finally changed to ampicillin when
susceptibilities resulted.

# Cholangitis: RUQ pain, fever, leukocytosis with bandemia, AST
979, ALT 723, AP 120, TB 3.5 and direct of 2.4. ERCP was
performed and a double pigtail plastic stent was placed. Her
hemodynamics remained stable. Blood cultures were positive for
gram negative rods, and she was treated with IV Zosyn.
Hepatitis serologies demonstrated previous hepatitis A exposure.
 She developed bacteremia (see below) and will continue
antibiotics until [**2-16**].  She will need ERCP follow up in 1 month
for repeat ERCP and stent placement.

# E. Coli and Enterococcus bacteremia both susceptible to
Ampicillin.  Pt initially on Zosyn, then changed to Vanco and
Ciprofloxacin given thrombocytopenia.  ID was consulted and did
not recommend cardiac imaging given that the likely source was
the biliary tree and surveillance cultures were negative.  She
was converted to ampicillin and should continue a 14 day course
since last negative culture ([**Date range (3) 1933**]).

# Shortness of breath likely [**12-21**] fluid overload: Patient was
intermittently tachypneic and wheezing and was treated with
albuterol nebs and lasix with improvement.  ECHO ordered to
evaluate for systolic or diastolic dysfunction.  She was found
to have restrictive filling pressures and elevated [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1934**].
 She will be discharged on lasix 10mg daily until she sees her
PMD.  She will need cardiology follow up given her disease.

# Thrombocytopenia: PLTs decreased to 83 ([**2-3**]) from 182 on
admission. Pt not on heparin, thought to be [**12-21**] sepsis at
admission. Hemolysis labs not concerning for DIC, and less
likely thought to be due to ITP or TTP. After discontinuation of
Zosyn, the platelets increased and remained stable. On
discharge, her platelets were 252.

# Hypertension: Lisinopril restarted in ICU. Atenolol and
Nifedipine restarted on the floor.  Blood pressures were well
controlled on the floor.

# GERD: Pantoprazole was started.

# Parkinson's disease: Continued Carbidopa-Levodopa

# Diverticulosis: Stable.  Guaiac negative stools.

# DVT prophylaxis: mechanical

Brief Hospital Course:
64M with h/o lung cancer in [**2169**] s/p resection, melanoma of left
arm s/p excision in [**2167**], who presented with left temporal
hemorrhage, secondary to metastatic melanoma, s/p craniotomy
with gross resection of lesion.

He initially presented after being found down and was admitted
to the ICU on neurosurgery service.  He underwent craintomy for
resection of his lesion and patholgoy returned as melanoma.

His hospital course was complicated by Afib with RVR and
ultimately rate controlled with oral diltizem and lopressor.  He
also developed enterobacter bacteremia and was treated for 14
days with meropenem.

Neuro-Oncology was contact[**Name (NI) **] to discuss the possibility of XRT
or other chemotherapeutic [**Doctor Last Name 360**] however, the patient was too
agitated to tolerate mapping and sitting still long enough for
XRT.  Systemic chemotherapy was not considered given the
patient's many co-morbidities.  Several family meetings were
held to discuss his prognosis.  Initially the decision was made
to wait to see if his mental status improved, unfortunately it
did not.  Another family meeting was held and the decision was
made by his health care proxy to have him to go hospice and
focus on comfort.

He is being discharged to hospice.  All non-comfort related
medications were stopped prior to discharge. He should be
continued on pain medication, medication for atrial fibrillation
including aspirin, anti-seizure medication and GERD medication.

[**2121-3-31**] - Coronary artery bypass grafting x3: Left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending artery, saphenous
vein graft to the diagonal, saphenous vein graft to the
posterior descending artery.


History of Present Illness:
This 66 year old man has a history of hypertension,
hyperlipidemia and obesity. He has been followed in the [**Month/Day/Year 2200**]
clinic for quite some time. Over the summer the patient noticed
several episodes of bilateral shoulder discomfort while walking
up a slight incline on the golf course. These episodes would
resolve quickly with rest and then he would be able to continue
on with the rest of his game without symptoms.

Several weeks ago the patient noticed similar bilateral shoulder
discomfort after walking only 100 feet.  He did not experience
any chest discomfort, shortness of breath or other associated
symptoms and again, after several minutes of rest his discomfort
resolved.

He sought consultation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2201**] who referred him for
stress testing. He exercised 8.25 minutes of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol,
reaching 79% of his maximum predicted heart rate. At peak
exercise there was diffuse 2.0-3.0 ST segment depression in the
inferior leads and 1.0-2.0 mm depression in leads I and V3-V6.
The rhythm was sinus with APB??????s and one PVC. Post exercise there
were frequent PVC??????s noted including ventricular bigeminy and
trigeminy. Imaging revealed a mostly reversible perfusion defect
of the septum and apex. A fixed inferior wall defect was also
noted.  LVEF was 48%. He is now referred for cardiac
catheterization to further evaluate.


Past Medical History:
Hypertension, osteoarthritis, hypercholesterol, basal cell
carcinoma

Social History:
He is a retired owner of an auto radiator
company. He drinks a couple of glasses of beer or wine weekdays.

He does not smoke. He does like to exercise frequently with golf

but finds that quite difficult these days with discomfort. He
rates his pain as [**8-8**] with activity, [**5-9**] at rest. It is
predominantly anterior medial.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2202**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2121-3-31**] for elective
surgical management of his coronary artery disease. He was taken
to the operating room where he underwent three vessel coronary
artery bypass grafting. Please see operative note for details.
Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. Over the next several hours, he awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated. He had hypotension requiring pressors.
He was transfused with a unit of packed red blood cells which.
On postoperative day two, he was transferred to the step down
unit for further recovery. He was gently diuresed towards his
preoperative weight. The physical therapy was consulted for
assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility. Stopped

Chief Complaint:
s/p ERCP with acute mental status changes/aspiration PNA

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP with sphincteroplasty
PEG tube placement (via Interventional Radiology)


History of Present Illness:
77 y/o F with PMhx of Developmental Delay, COPD, HL, HTN and
Mirizzi syndrome who presented today for elective ERCP.  Pt was
felt to be functionning at baseline prior to procedure with mild
agitation, pulling at PIVs but interacting with staff.  She was
given fent/midaz for ERCP with stent placement and was
transferred to the post-ERCP suite in stable condition. She had
elevated BPs during the procedure requiring labetalol and
metoprolol. She was found mildly tachypneic/wheezing with emesis
on her gown. It was felt likely that she had an aspiration event
with low grade temp  However, she was still moving all four
extremities and responding appropriately to questions though
mildly sedated prior to transfer to the floor.
.
On arrival to the floor, pt was minimally responsive to sternal
rub and did not withdraw to focal stimuli.  She was notably
tachypneic and eyes were deviated to right side.  She was able
to track to left with stimuli and would intermittently open eyes
to command.   Pt had an ABG 7.4/36/92 with lactate of 3.5 and
CXR showed a right lower lobe infiltrate.  Due to concern for
acute intracranial hemmorrhage, she was taken down for a stat CT
head.  On return to the floor, pt was given narcan without any
significant change in mental status.  Neuro was consulted for
possible acute stroke and within a few minutes, she became more
responsive, opening eyes spontaneously. By the time neuro came
to bedside, pt was able to verbalize her name and was noted to
be using the right arm and had left sided deficit.  A CODE
stroke was called and pt was taken for urgent CTA head which did
not show any vessel obstruction and TPA was felt unlikely to be
helpful.  Perfusion images confirmed right temporal
hypoperfusion consistent with clinical exam and likely right MCA
infarct.  ICU consult was initiated and pt's guardian was
notified.  Pt was given Vanc/Cefepime and Aspirin 300mg PR while
awaiting ICU transfer.  She was lying flat per neuro recs and
was noted to be spitting up bilious emesis.  Head of bed was
elevated and pt was suctionned prior to transferred to the ICU
for closer monitoring of airway and management of acute
pneumonia.

Past Medical History:
Hypertension
Developmental Delay
Mirizzi Syndrome
COPD


Social History:
At baseline, pt lives at a nursing home and is able to feed
herself, undress and can transfer from chair to bed but is
otherwise wheelchair bound.  No smoking/ETOH history documented.

ERCP [**2182-10-17**]
Procedures: A plastic stent was removed.
Impression: 2 balloon sweeps were performed with a small stone,
sludge and debris removed. A 1.5 cm biliary stricture in mid-CBD
compatible with known cystic duct stone and mirrizi syndrome was
visualized. A 10 F 5cm double pigtailed catheter was placed.
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum.

CXR [**2182-10-17**] IMPRESSION: Right lower lobe pneumonia with
atelectasis or pneumonia at the left base.
.
CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS IMPRESSION: Moderate-to-severe
intracranial atherosclerotic disease with findings suggestive of
decreased perfusion to the right MCA/PCA watershed region. The
findings may represent cerebral ischemia in the setting of
hypovolemia, hypotension or other causes of decreased cardiac
output.
.
Cardiac Echo: IMPRESSION: Small LV cavity size with mild
symmetric LVH and hyperdynamic LV systolic function.
Consequently, there is a mild to moderate LV outflow tract
gradient. No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
.
RUE LENI IMPRESSION: Partially occlusive thrombus in the right
basilic and axillary veins at site of PICC line. Clot does not
extend more centrally.
.
ABDOMEN (SUPINE ONLY) PORT IMPRESSION: Limited view of the
abdomen demonstrating no evidence for obstruction. Bladder
stone.

Brief Hospital Course:
77 y/o F with PMhx of Developmental Delay, COPD, HL, HTN and
Mirizzi syndrome who presented on [**10-17**] for elective ERCP. Pt
was noted to have emesis on her gown in the post procedure suite
with diffuse wheezes and low grade temp. It was thought likely
that she had an aspiration event and when she was arrived on the
floor, she had a profoundly depressed mental status, tachypnea
and fever to 101.9.  Further stat work up revealed evidence of
aspiration PNA, leukocytosis and elevated lactate.  Initial head
imaging was unrevealing. However, she became more alert and was
noted to have an acute left sided deficit. CODE STROKE was
called and CTA/perfusion images confirmed right sided
hypoperfusion likely consistent with right MCA stroke.  Neuro
felt there was no indication for TPA given patent intracranial
vessels and on return to the floor, pt was noted to have bilious
secretions that she was having difficulty clearing.  She was
transferred to the ICU for airway monitoring overnight. Pt was
called out to the floor when she was able to cough and spit up
secretions.  She was noted to have a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental
status, sometimes will respond to commands and other times will
not.  BP was allowed to autoregulate for the first 72 hrs post
event and pt was continued on Aspirin 300mg daily.  She was
noted to have recovery of left arm function and was answering
yes/no to questions.

She was seen by PT/OT who recommended ongoing therapy upon
return to NH.
After discussion with HCP/guardian, decision was made to avoid
follow up MRI as it was not likely to change care plan and pt
was unlikely to tolerate the procedure.  Echo was performed to
rule out cardioembolic source which did not show any thrombus.
Lipid panel showed LDL in the 93, and Hgb A1c 9.4.  She was
hyperglycemic during the hospitalization, and she was started on
Lantus and sliding scale insulin.
.
Aspiration PNA: Pt was noted to have aspiration event s/p
procedure and was monitored in the ICU for 24hrs given concern
for her ability to protect airway .  Leukocytosis, lactate and
fevers resolved after initiation of Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
Respiratory status improved and pt had a PICC placed and she
completed a course of antibiotics.

Upper Extremity DVT- Patient was subsequently developed a DVT
associated with the PICC line. The PICC line was discontinued
and she was started on Lovenox.  Once a PEG tube was placed, she
was started on Warfarin for a goal INR of [**2-6**].  Please follow
INR closely and titrate prn.  She received her first dose of
Warfarin 5 mg on [**11-2**].

Aspiration - Pt was seen by speach/swallow on multiple
occasions, which she grossly failed with aspiration.  She was
kept strictly NPO, and she was maintained with IV medications
and hydration.  A dobhoff was placed for initiation of tube
feeds, while waiting to see if she would regain her swallow
function.  It is/was hoped that her swallow function would
improve, especially considering her significant recovery in her
left arm movement, however, she did not show significant
improvement on serial exams.  In discussion with Speech and
Swallow, however, there is some hope that she may recover her
swallow on a long term basis, and Swallow therapy may help with
this recovery.  They suggested an approximate 50% chance of
recovery to the point of safe oral intake in the long-term.
.
Diabetes-Pt with uncontrolled hyperglycemia after the initiation
of tube feeds. Her lantus and insulin sliding scales were
agressively increased. She is being discharged on 70 units of
lantus, and a sliding scale.
.
Mirizzi Syndrome s/p ERCP: Pt with abnormal biliary anatomy who
underwent stent and sphincteroplastyon [**10-17**] for recurrent abd
pain. She was noted to have an acute rise in transaminases post
procedure and these trended down with normal Tbili.  Pt was
followed by ERCP team while in house.
.
Developmental Delay: baseline confirmed with her guardian/mother
and nursing home.
.
HTN: held BP meds to allow autoregulation s/p stroke. She was
subsequently treated with IV metoprolol, clonidine patch, and IV
lasix, with benefit. After obtaining access via PEG, a blood
pressure medication regimen via PEG was begun. I expect that she
will benefit from further titration of medications as an
outpatient.  Please note that she was also started on
Lisinopril; please follow up lytes in 1 week to ensure she
tolerates.
.
Hyperlipidemia: Patient's simvastatin was held while patient was
NPO. This was resumed after obtaining access via PEG. This
medication dose was increased to 40 mg for goal LDL <70
considering diabetes and stroke.  Please follow up LFT's to
ensure tolerating, and lipid profile to ensure she meets her
targets.
.
CODE: DNR/DNI confirmed with guardian

for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2**]. Radiographically, the differential includes
pulmonary edema. Additionally, there is a faint opacity at the
right lung base, which may represent atelectasis or focal
pneumonic process.
.
CT-Head [**11-16**]: Focus of low attenuation within the subcortical
white matter of the right medial frontal lobe. This may
represent a subacute infarction; however, an underlying mass
lesion cannot be completely excluded. An MRI examination with
gadolinium and diffusion-weighted imaging is recommended for
further evaluation. No intracranial hemorrhage noted.
.
MR-head-w&w/o gadolinium [**11-18**]:
Signal abnormality in the medial right frontal lobe involving
the corpus callosum does not demonstrate enhancement. This
finding most likely represent a small infarct. However, in
absence of ADC map, age of the infarct could not be determined.
No abnormal enhancement is seen. Follow up is suggested, if
clinically indicated.
.
Echo [**11-18**]:
1.The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. While difficult to
assess given the limited views suspect Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
.
If clinically indicated, would recommend a TEE.
.
CXR [**11-21**]:
Resolution of congestive failure with persistent small bilateral
pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis
.
Studies:
EEG [**11-17**]: This is a mildly abnormal EEG due to the presence of
a slow
and disorganized background with bursts of generalized slowing -
all
consistent with a mild encephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, or
anoxic
etiology. No evidence for ongoing seizures is seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  54 woman on immunosuppressive therapy for UC (prednisone,
6MP) who presents with new onset HA, fever with bacterial
meningitis and gram positive rod bacteremia.
.
#. Listeriosis - meningitis and bacteremia. Patient presented
with headache, nuchal rigidity, expressive aphasia, afebrile on
admission but temp to 104.4 in the ED, where she also started to
have rigors.  LP showed >300 WBC, poly predominant with 5%
monocytes, protein 152 glucose 16.  CSF gram stain showed gram
positive rods, blood culture grew gram positive rods, speciation
eventually grew listeria. Empiric treatment based on gram stain
was started: ampicillin and bactrim (to cover both nocardia and
question of PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3**] below), vanc and ceftriaxone as well pending
confirmation of gram stain and culture results.  Once
speciations was confirmed, a five day course of gentamicin was
started for synergy, and vancomycin and ceftriaxone d/c'd.
Bactrim was maintained on treatment dose for concern for PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 4**] [**11-21**], when it was changed to prophylaxis dose.  Early on
admission, she developed hypotension that required levophed, but
was weaned off of pressors within the first couple of days of
admission with PRBCs (total of 4 units) and volume
resussitation.  Given bacteremia, TTE was done, no vegetations
or lesions noted. Head CT on admission showed right medial
frontal lobe likely infarct versus mass lesion, no hemorrhage.
Subsequent MRI confirmed infarct, unclear date, and EEG
consistent with meningitis.  Neurology was consulted, and the
patient was placed on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis given
meningoencephalitis. She spiked fevers to 101-102 over the first
several days of admission.  By [**11-19**], her neurological exam was
markedly improved, and by [**11-21**] her headache was gone, no
meningeal signs noted, although her baseline essential tremor
was slightly more severe. Surveillance blood cultures reamined
negative from [**11-17**] on.  Notably, she was transferred from ICU
to floor on [**11-21**], but noninvasive BP was read as 60/d, patient
mentating well, sent back to ICU. In the ICU, an arterial line
was placed, and consistently read 20-30 mmHg higher than
sphyngomanometer.  This discrepancy was of unclear etiology, but
persistent.  Patient maintained normal mentation, good urine
output, no tachycardia, and it was judged that, for some unclear
reason, the cuff pressures underestimated by 20-30 points.  On
[**11-23**], she was sent to the floor for further care and management.
.
#. Bilateral lung opacities/hypoxia. Initial chest film read as
increased opacities bilaterally concerning for PCP (given
steroids and no PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 5**]) vs. bacterial pneumonia vs. pulmonary
edema. She had signifcant oxygen requirement, and her
respiratory distress led to her being placed on CPAP+PS.  The
origin of her significant hypoxia was originally thought to be
secondary to likely vascular leak from sepsis/CHF versus PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 6**]
induced sputum was attempted, but was unsuccessful, and was not
repeated initally given her unstable respiratory status, and
susbsequent evaluation that likelihood of PCP was small.  She
responded well to lasix diuresis, with reduced O2 requirements.
.
#. UC: She continued to receive her outpatient dose of
prednisone, which was changed on [**11-22**] to dexamethasone IV; her
outpatient 6-MP was held. After several days with no diarrhea,
it recurred on [**11-22**] soon after her diet had advanced. C.diff was
negative. She was made NPO, and fed via TPN for bowel rest.  On
[**11-24**], it was noted that she began passing BRBRP, her hematocrit
was noted to drop two points and pt was typed and crossed and
consent for blood transfusion.
.
#. Anemia. On admission, she was found to be anemic. She
received PRBCs for anemia on admission and again [**11-19**] for mixed
venous sat <70%.  She was found to have iron binding studies c/w
anemia of chronic disease.  Her HCT was followed closely, and
remained stable for the remainder of her admission.
.
#. FEN: Her diet was advanced as tolerated, but she was made NPO
with TPN on [**11-22**] after she developed diarrhea, thought secondary
to continued UC activity.
.
#. Prophylaxis: PPI. Hold SQ Hep, pneumoboots. Initially on
droplet precautions.
.
#. Code status: FULL
.
#. Communication: patient, her sister, brother, and mother
.
#. Lines: peripheral IV x 2. left subclavian CC.  A-line. Eval
for PICC; once in place, can d/c central line, a-line.

Surgery Discharge part:
Pt underwent total abdominal colectomy with ileoostomy on
[**2147-11-26**].  She was on Clinda/Gent peri-procedure and Amplicillin
for 21 days at first.  She was seen by PT/OT and was NPO until
the ostomy started to function.  SHe had c/o nausea as diet was
tolerated and it was slowed down.  MRI was suspicious for an
abcess and amplicillin was started for at least a total of 6
weeks as per ID.  She was given a PICC.  On [**12-5**] she was
cleared by PT and was in good condition for d/c to rehab on
[**2147-12-5**].

presented on day 13 of second cycle of chemotherapy with fever
to 100.6 at home w/ severe rigors. She took two Ibuprofen at
home and then went to onc clinic today where she was then
referred to the ED for admission. She stated that for the past
two days she has noticed an increasing amount of stool output in
her ostomy bag but denies abdominal discomfort or blood in her
stool. She has had nausea but similar to how she has felt in the
past with chemo. She also mentioned that she recently cut her

show definitive source of infection either. She was started on
Cefepime for neutropenic fever. While in the ED she developed
hypotension not responding to IVF boluses, the pt denied CVL
placement and required the initiation of phenylepherine

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 14**] is a 61 yo w/ Stage II breast cancer who was
admitted on day 13 or cycle 2 of Docetaxel (Taxotere) +
Cyclophosphomide who developed fever to 100.6 at home with
associated rigors in the setting of neutropenia.
.
#Neutropenic Fever- On presentation the pt's PMN count was 21
most likely from her most recent chemotherapy cycle and lack of
Neulasta use. Two possible sources of infection existed
including pulmonary or from a laceration on her finger suffered
while gardening. She was broadly covered with Vancomycin and
cefepime to cover both possible sources, as well as flagyl to
cover for cdiff as the patient mentioned that she had increased
ostomy output.  When cdiff returned negative, flagyl was
discontinued. Blood cultures were sent and a U/A was not
concerning for infection. We also sent off galactomannan antigen
and beta-D-glucan labs initially as part of her neutropenic
fever workup which were negative. The following day after
admission her WBC rose significantly and she no longer was
neutropenic. As her WBC rose she started to develope a cough and
he CXR became concerning for an infiltrate. She was continued on
Vanc/Cefepime until afebrile and with ANC>1000 for greater than
48 hours, after which she was switched to PO levofloxacin to
complete an 8 day total course for community acquired pneumonia.
.
# Hypotension- In the [**Name (NI) **] pt's SBP dropped to 70s, not responding
to IVF boluses. She refused central line placement in the ED and
peripheral pressors were initiated. This is most likely related
to her underlying infectious process. She was not administered
any medications recently that could be accounting for her
hypotension. Looking through OMR her baseline blood pressures
are sbp of 90s-100s. An a-line was obtained which showed higher
BP than what was being recorded by the blood pressure cuff. She
was given several liters of IV fluid boluses and weaned off
pressors the night of admission to the ICU. Her cuff and a-line
pressures correlated after fluid resuscitation and the a-line
was discontinued.
.
# Breast Cancer- currently in cycle 2 of Docetaxel (Taxotere) +
Cyclophosphomide. Most likely this current episode of
neutropenia is due to the fact that Neulasta was not given
during this cycle of chemo per pt's request, however due to the
rapid rise in her WBC count myelosuppression from sepsis was
also a possibility.
.
# Depression / Anxiety- Continue Duloxetine and clonazepam at
home doses.
.
# Nausea- Continued compazine and PO zofran prn.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear [**Known firstname 17**],

It was a pleasure to take care of you here at [**Hospital1 18**]. You were
admitted for low white cell (neutrophil count), fever, and
pneumonia. You required monitoring with blood pressure
supporting medications and IV antibiotics in the intensive care
unit. Fortunately, your counts improved and you responded nicely
to the antibiotics. Please continue to take levofloxacin to
treat your pneumonia for a total of 8 days (last dose on
[**2154-5-7**]). As we discussed if you notice fever, worsening
breathing problems, or any other concerning symptoms to return
to the emergency room immediately.

We have made the following changes to your medications:

START levofloxacin 750mg by mouth daily for 4 more days
([**2154-5-7**])

You should discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19**] the possibility of restarting
neulasta with your next chemotherapy cycle.

History of Present Illness:
49 year-old man with a history of presumed [**Location (un) 849**] Gastaut
Syndrome and with a recent complicated medical history presents
this morning for a [**Location (un) 862**] in the setting of fever.  The patient
is nonverbal and the history was obtained through medical record
.
The patient was reportedly well yesterday, and was stable when
last checked at 11 pm. He was noted to be ""shaking all over""
with erratic breathing at ~3:40 am; the episode lasted about 10
minutes or so. EMS was dispatched to the patient's group home
shortly thereafter. He was apparently not seizing by the time
emergency personnel arrived.  His temperature on the scene was
101 F with a blood pressure 128/72, pulse 112, and a respiratory
rate of 16. He was described as pale and unresponsive.  The
patient was brought to the ER, where his temperature was 100.1 F
in triage.
.
In ED, vitals notable for fever of 102.8 rectally.  The patient
was given Vancomycin 1 gm IV, Ceftriaxone 2 gm IV, 2L NS, and
acetaminophen 650 mg PR. Patient also noted to leukocytosis,
lactate 1.2, dirty urine, clear CXR and negative head CT.
.

.
[**2164-11-23**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia at 100 bpm with delayed R wave
progression which is non-specific. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2164-9-5**] there is no significant change.
.
[**2164-11-23**] CXR: FINDINGS: The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
within normal limits given leftward rotation. No radiographic
evidence of pneumonia is detected. Pulmonary vascularity appears
within normal limits. No effusion or pneumothorax. Arm in the
down position limits evaluation on the lateral
radiograph. IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of pneumonia
given limitations.
.
[**2164-11-23**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of
hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect, or infarction. The
ventricles and sulci are prominent consistent with early
involutional changes. No acute fractures are identified. The
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well
aerated. IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process.
.
[**2164-11-23**] PORTABLE ABD X-RAY: FINDINGS: Single frontal radiograph
of the abdomen shows a non-obstructive nondilated bowel gas
pattern. There is no free gas or pneumatosis. A mild amount of
retained fecal material is present. Visualized osseous
structures are unremarkable and there are no soft tissue
calcifications. IMPRESSION: 1. No radiographic evidence of toxic
megacolon.
.
[**2164-11-26**] RIGHT ANKLE X-RAY: FINDINGS: Four views of the right
ankle are submitted. Screw tracts are present in the distal
fibula and there is residual osseous deformity from prior
fracture. The fracture is healed. The talus is abnormally
rotated with respect to the calcaneus and there is a medial
talar tilt. There is abnormal varus angulation of the foot. No
osseous findings to suggest osteomyelitis at this time.
.
[**2164-11-30**] ABD X-RAY: FINDINGS: Two frontal and two lateral
decubitus radiographs of the abdomen are interpreted in
comparison with radiograph from [**2164-11-23**]. Images show
an air-filled colon with associated minimal dilatation. Note is
made of a paucity of bowel gas in the area of the rectum.
Decubitus view show scattered air-fluid levels within the colon.
The small bowel shows scattered air-filled loops with no
dilatation. There is no free air and there is no pneumatosis.
Tiny pelvic phlebolith is seen as well as a 10 x 7 mm ovoid
calcific density in the deep pelvis which is unchanged when
compared to CT studies from [**2164-5-13**]. Visualized osseous
structures are notable for a mild dextroconvex lumbar curvature.
IMPRESSION: Air-filled loop of colon with minimal dilatation,
though a paucity of gas is seen in the rectum and distal sigmoid
overall concerning for possible obstruction in the appropriate
clinical setting.
.
[**2164-11-30**] CT ABD/PELVIS W/ CONTRAST:
- CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There are left greater
than right bibasilar opacities, likely representing atelectasis,
left basal opacity is slightly more concerning for aspiration.
There is thickening of the distal esophagus. The liver, spleen,
adrenal glands, pancreas are unremarkable. Kidneys enhance
equally and excrete contrast normally. There is no free air, no
free fluid, no pathologically enlarged mesenteric or
retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Abdominal loops of small bowel are
not dilated. The contrast passes through the small bowel into
the colon, reaching distal transverse colon. There is fecal
material and gas noted throughout the descending colon as well
as gas present in the rectum. Normal appendix is seen. The cecum
is very large and displaces the sigmoid colon.
- CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon
are unremarkable. Urinary bladder wall demonstrates concentric
thickening, which may be due to underdistension, chronic UTI can
have this appearance. There is no pelvic fluid and no
pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes.
Bilateral inguinal nodes measure up to 9 mm in short axis
diameter. The prostate is enlarged up to 5 cm in transverse
dimension.
- BONE WINDOWS: Demonstrate no concerning lytic or sclerotic
lesions. Anterior compression deformity of T12 vertebral body is
stable.
- IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of small bowel obstruction or stool impaction.
Distended cecum with mass effect on the sigmoid, intermittent
obstruction may be result.
2. Bibasilar atelectasis, left lower lobe opacity is concerning
for aspiration if the patient is at risk.
3. Concentric urinary bladder wall thickening, greater in extent
compared to the prior study. Cystitis can also have this
appearance; outlet obstruction less likely given more normal
appearance on [**2164-6-12**] studies.

[**2164-12-3**] ENDOSCOPY:Erythema and congestion and superficial
erosion in the gastroesophageal junction compatible with mild
esophagitis
Mucosa suggestive of Barrett's esophagus (biopsy) Erythema and
congestion in the stomach body and antrum compatible with mild
gastritis (biopsy) Normal mucosa in the first part of the
duodenum, second part of the duodenum and third part of the
duodenum (biopsy) Small hiatal hernia

Brief Hospital Course:
49 year-old man with a history of presumed [**Location (un) 849**] Gastaut
Syndrome and epilepsy presents with a in the setting of fever.
.
# Seizures: Patient has a well-known seizures history due to
[**Location (un) 849**] Gastaut, although his [**Location (un) 850**] believes his
presentation may have been due to an episode of rigors in the
setting of fever and leukocytosis. Corrected phenytoin level was
9.1 on admission, and he received additional phenytoin 300 mg IV
x 1. CT head negative. Infectious work-up remarkable only for
UTI, for which pt completed a 7-day course of
amoxicillin/ampicillin. He was switched back to outpatient oral
phenytoin dose but continued to have seizures lasting up to half
a minute, which was determined by neurology to be consistent
with baseline seizures. Rechecked corrected phenytoin level was
5, and pt given additional bolus of phenytoin 150 mg IV and then
started on increased dose of phenytoin 150 mg po bid. Phenytoin
and albumin levels should be followed to ensure therapeutic
level of [**9-26**]; level was 7.2 on day of discharge, neurology
called, recommended rechecking level in [**12-14**] weeks with albumin.
.
# Fever/Leukocytosis: Per [**Date Range 850**], patient with fevers on
and off for months so fever work-up initiated. Lactate nl, RF
slightly elevated. CXR negative. Vancomycin discontinued as LP
without evidence. Ceftriaxone stopped and continued on
ampicillin/amoxicillin (dependent on NPO status) for UTI, which
grew out VRE. As patient initially still spiking fevers with
markedly elevated CRP, R foot x-ray done to rule out R ankle
osteomyelitis given history of this. Patient subsequently
defervesced and leukocytosis resolved. Of note, CT abd/pelvis
showed left greater than right bibasilar opacities, likely
representing atelectasis, but left basal opacity slightly more
concerning for aspiration. Unable to correlate with exam as
limited by cooperation but as pt remained afebrile off
antibiotics and as evaluated on this admission by Speech/Swallow
with no signs of aspiration, did not pursue further work-up.
Would recommend repeat CXR if pt does spike a new fever.
.
# Enterococcus UTI: As above, completed 7-day course of
antibiotics.
.
# ?Aspiration pneumonia: Reevaluated by Speech/Swallow on this
admission with no evidence of aspiration with thin liquids.
Recommended to continue ground diet, thin liquids, and whole
pills mixed with food. Questionable left-sided aspiration
pneumonia on CT abd/pelvis as above; would repeat CXR if pt
spikes new fever.
.
# R/o Barrett's esophagus: Pt scheduled for outpatient endoscopy
to evaluate this but done as inpatient. Of note, CT abd/pelvis
showed thickening of the distal
esophagus. Pt underwent endoscopy on [**2164-12-3**] which showed
concern for Barrett's esophagus.  Biopsies will need to be
followed up.
.
# Anemia: Hct remained stable but given h/o iron deficiency
anemia also seen on labs on this admission, pt repleted with IV
iron and discharged with oral iron supplements. Attempt made to
perform colonoscopy as inpatient given this and as pt nearing
routine screening age but was hampered by inadequate bowel prep
despite prolonged efforts involving multiple bottles of mag
citrate and tap water enemas. Would still recommend pursuing in
the long run given persistent iron deficiency anemia and
possibility of detecting colon cancer at an early stage.
.
# Constipation: Pt inadequately bowel prepped for colonoscopy
likely secondary to high rectal stool impaction out of reach
manually. However, abdomen soft with no evidence of obstruction
on CT abd/pelvis. Would recommend maintaining a good, regular
bowel regimen daily as outpatient to prevent stool impaction,
especially in anticipation of need for outpatient colonoscopy in
the future.
.
# Enlarged prostate: Per CT abdomen/pelvis, the prostate is
enlarged up to 5 cm in transverse dimension. Pt able to void
bladder. Would follow up as outpatient.
.
# Transaminitis: Mild elevation which subsequently resolved.
Abdominal exam benign. [**Month (only) 116**] have been secondary to med effect v.
viral infection. Viral hepatitis panel negative.
.
# Peripheral neuropathy: Thought to be secondary to dilantin.
Continued on outpatient Vitamin B12
.
# Mental Retardation: Mental status at baseline as per attendant
from group home.

Brief Hospital Course:
49 y/o M with a history of [**Location (un) 849**] Gastaut Syndrome who is
nonverbal at baseline who presents with fever and associated
vomiting for 1 day and a leukocytosis, with exam, oxygen
requirement, and imaging consistent with health-care associated
pneumonia.

1. Pneumonia: Patient presented with fever to 101 and
leukocytosis with a CXR consistent with left base consolidation
and a new supplemental O2 requirement. Was found to be
hypotensive in the ED, although volume responsive and was
normotensive on arrival to the MICU. Although a nursing home
resident, he was initially covered in the ED with vanco,
ceftriaxone, and azithromycin, and he defervesced overnight and
so was continued on this regimen at the time of transfer to the
regular floors. Blood cultures drawn in the ED prior to
antibiotics were negative. On the floor, pt had fever to 100.8
and was broadened to vancomcyin, zosyn and azithromycin. He lost
IV access and was briefly transitioned to PO regimen with
linezolid, flagyl, and levofloxacin.  He did well for >36 hours
with no fever or leukocytosis on this oral regimen so decision
was made to contiune treatment on oral antibiotics to be
completed at home.  Repeat CXR in [**2-13**] weeks recommended to
ensure complete resolution.

2.  [**Location (un) 849**] Gastaut Syndrome: At best pt has [**4-17**] sz/wk and can
often have daily seizures. Was continued on home anti-epileptic
regimen including phenytoin, keppra, and felbatol. Dilantin
levels were measured and were therapeutic. Pt did not have any
seizures during hospitalization.

3. Anemia: baseline of 30-33. Hct at baseline during admission.
He has a history of chronic GI bleeds, had several guaiac
positive stools during admission, however Hct stable throughout
hospitalization. On ferrous sulfate TID usually, but was changed
to daily considering h/o constipation.

4. Dysphagia: Continued a ground diet with thickened liquids and
pills crushed in ice cream or applesauce, at the time of
discharge he was tolerating his diet well

5. Diarrhea: pt with several loose stools during admission, C
diff negative x 3.  Resolved at time of discharge.

6. Barrett's Esophagus: Continued [**Hospital1 **] PPI.

7. Osteoporosis: stable, continued his TUMS

8. Peripheral Neuropathy: remained stable, continued vitamin B12

9. Prophylaxis: Patient received heparin products during
admission.

10. Code: Full code

Issues on discharge:
Repeat CXR in [**2-13**] weeks recommended to ensure complete
resolution.

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
bloody diarrhea x 2 weeks

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
colonoscopy x 2 (+1 failed [**12-23**] poor prep)
Tagged RBC GI bleeding study

History of Present Illness:
83yo woman with h/o diverticulosis, C. Diff who presents with
bloody diarrhea for 2 weeks. States is constipated at baseline
(1 BM qod), and has a h/o hemorrhoids so she initially thought
her bloody diarrhea was hemorrhoidal bleeding. Her BM frequency
increased to 2-3BM's day from baseline. The color was darker
than normal for her. The diarrhea was unusually malordorous. She
came to [**Hospital1 18**] because she just wasn't getting better and was fed
up with wearing sanitary pads. Also worried because her sister
passed away from colon CA last year (age 81). Denies any
abdominal pain or N/V. No CP, no SOB. She has been tolerating
POs normally but notes a slightly decreased appetite and weight
loss of 5 pounds. Feels tired and weak but denies dizziness or
lightheadedness. No recent hospitalizations but was hospitalized
last year in [**Month (only) **] for pneumonia, developed C. Diff which
required 3 months of treatment.
.
In the ER she was found to have a hct of 38 (baseline), she had
guaiac positive melena on exam. She received 1L NS. GI was
called and recommended CT abdomen with contrast, which was
negative for colitis, showed patent arteries, and showed
diverticulosis without diverticulitis. They recommended
colonoscopy in AM, and she was begun on GoLytely prep. However,
the patient did not tolerate this and was changed to Mag
Citrate. She also received 1 unit of PRBCs.
.
On admission to the fllor she feels well but weak. BMs are still
dark, mixed with blood.

Past Medical History:
PMHx:
- HTN
- PPD positive

diverticulosis -- due for next scope in [**2192-8-20**]
- macular degeneration


Social History:
lives home with friend. Retired GE worker. walking for exercise
is limited by her breathing trouble with bronchiectasis. no
tobacco, rare EtOH, no other drugs.

GI BLEEDING STUDY  [**2192-5-24**]
IMPRESSION: Bleeding from the distal sigmoid/rectum.
.
ECHO [**5-24**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left ventricular cavity
size is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is a severe resting left
ventricular outflow tract obstruction (peak gradient >150 mmHg)
in the setting of hyperdynamic state. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is systolic anterior motion
of the mitral valve leaflets. Mild to moderate ([**11-22**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
83yo woman with h/o diverticulosis, C.Diff, presented with
bloody diarrhea x 2 weeks. Infectious causes ruled out (neg
CDiff, campy, salm, shig), and CT negative for mesenteric
ischemia. Colonoscopy [**5-21**] found a bleeding sigmoid diverticulum
that was injected with epinephrine with good hemostasis. In
setting of GIB anemia and demand ischemia, pt suffered mild
NSTEMI. Pt began to pass bloody stools again, necessitating RBC
transfusions to maintain HCT. Tagged RBC study showed rebleed in
sigmoid colon not amenable to angio. GI re-scoped on [**5-25**], which
showed normal colon with no bleeding. Pt.'s HCT remained stable
until disharge and did not have further bleeding.
.
# GIB: Presented with 2 weeks of bleeding at home. Infectious
etiologies ruled out. Mesenteric ischemia ruled out by CT.
Diverticular bleed found on first colonoscopy, epi injected, but
patient with continued LGIB which was seen in the distal sigmoid
on tagged RBC study [**5-24**]. The bleeding was not deemed amenable to
angio intervention. She continued to be supported with aggresive
pRBC trasfusions until her repeat colonoscopy on [**5-25**] which
showed a no source of bleeding. She did not have any further
bloody BMs and was hemodyamically stable as of [**2192-5-29**].
.
# CHEST PAIN: Patient has had negative CKs but small troponin
leak, ? 1mm ST depressions on EKG from [**5-21**]. Likely represents
mild NSTEMI from demand ischemia, as tends to recur only when
patient drops her hematocrit to the mid 20's. Cardiology
consulted, agree that this represents demand ischemia, recommend
agressive transfusion. Echo obtained showed LVOF obstruction in
setting of hyperdynamic state, mild-moderate MR, but no wall
motion abnormalities. ASA was initally given but held per GI
recommendations. Patient was put on metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **] in the
setting of her NSTEMI. Pt. will follow up with cardiology as
outpatient [**2192-6-5**].
.
#SOB: after aggressive volume resuscitation and blood
transfusions, the patient began to experience SOB and tachypnea.
A CXR was c/w volume overload and CHF. She was treated with
Lasix 10mg x 2, which excellent diuretic effect and symptomatic
relief. Pt. was started on Lasix 20mg QD on discharge.
.
# HTN: We held her diuretic throughout her stay in the setting
of her GIB, and restarted B blocker during her admission
(metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **]). Her home diltiazem was held.
.
# BRONCHIECTASIS: Continued on home meds of albuterol MDI prn,
spiriva qd. Added albuterol/atrovent nebulizers.
.
# PPX: Received PPI, avoided heparin throughout given her bleed,
used pneumoboots.
.
# FEN: Although often NPO for procedures, she ate a heart
healthy cardiac diet. IV NS as necessary.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo F w/ DM2, HTN, PA HTN p/w SOB and LE edema x1 week, now
with severe anemia
(hct of 17 noted by her PCP) thought to be secondary to UGIB,
hemodynamically stable s/p 6 Units of bld w/ increase of hct to
30. serial hcts q 6 hrs remained stable at 30.

Pt had EGD in ED ([**2132-9-5**]) which revealed granularity,
friability and erythema in the stomach body, fundus and antrum
compatible with acute gastritis (biopsy obtained). Erythema in
the duodenal bulb compatible with duodenitis. Ulcer in the
distal bulb. Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the
duodenum.

Echo:([**2132-8-23**])
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%).
3. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
5. Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed)
of [**2128-8-18**], there has been no significant change.

1. GIB with increased BUN, likely UGIB, however LGIB initially
considered as well.
Pt had 2 large bore IV's placed.  NG lavage was positive as well
as stool guiacs. EGD as above. No active bleed noted however
ulcer and gastritis likely source of anemia. Ulcer thought to be
secondary to NSAID use vs H. pylori.  Will treat for H.Pylori if
indicated. Pt will follow up with GI. ASA was held secondary to
bleed.  Losartan was initially held, then restarted at half
normal dose. NSAIDs were avoided. Initially given IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
which was then changed to po. Colonoscopy performed was reported
to be normal.

2. Cardiac. EKG changes (NSR at 84, Nl axis and intervals, TWI
III, TWI V1-V4). Pt was ruled out for MI with three sets of neg
cardiac enzymes. She denied CP. ECG changes likely secondary to
demand ischemia from severe anemia. She was initially monitored
on tele with no events. An echo done on [**2132-8-23**], as above
(LVEF>55%). SOB most likely due to discontinuation of lasix for
one week in setting of diastolic CHF. Treated with 40 of lasix
IV (held off on diuresis intially secondary to concern for GI
bld).

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 31**] is a 62 y.o. woman with primary progressive MS
[**Name13 (STitle) 32**] in [**2143**] with spasticity s/p intrathecal baclofen pump
placment in '[**64**], s/p tracheostomy in '[**65**] [**1-8**] to chronic
respiratory weakness, recurrent UTIs, aspiration PNAs, who
presents after being found to be febrile and unresponsive at her
nursing home.  According to notes from [**Hospital6 33**], the
pt was found at her nursing home yesterday ([**3-26**]) AM, shaking
her head repeatedly, subsequently becoming obtunded (presumed
seizure). She was taken by EMS to [**Hospital1 34**] ED.
.
In the ED at [**Name (NI) 34**], pts vitals were: Tm 103.6, HR 110-150s RR
12-18 SaO2 98-99%NRB. Soon after, pt supposedly seized in the
ED, was given Ativan, Ambu'd and subsequently placed on SIMV
ventilation. Pt was empirically started on Vancomycin, Levoquin,
Ceftriaxone, Bactrim and Acyclovir. On exam, it was noted that
the skin overlying the baclofen pump (RUQ) appeared inflamed.
Labs were notable for a WBC of 25 with 68%polys and a bandemia
of 20%. U/A with 50-100 WBC, +leukocyte esterase, +nitrite. LP
was performed and CSF analysis showed 7,250 WBCs with 92% polys,
glucose 10, TP 1440, and gm stain with many polys, few gm+
cocci. Bcx revealed gm+ cocci in chains in [**3-9**] bottles. Micro
lab performed latex agglutination on CSF sample which was
positive for group B strep. Vanc and Ceftriaxone were dc'd and
ampicillin 2gm IV + benadryl given. Hydrocortisone 80mg was also
given. Left SC line and NGT were also placed at [**Hospital1 34**]. CXR showed
cardiomegaly but no infiltrate. Abdominal CT was negative for an
abscess or fluid collection surrounding the pump. Head CT showed
questionable changes from prior that might suggest the
possibility of a right MCA infarct. Pt was transferred directly
to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for further management.


Past Medical History:
PMH:
1. Chronic progressive multiple sclerosis - dx'd in [**2143**] when pt
was 34 years old; on intrathecal baclofen pump ('[**64**]) for
spasticity
2. Recurrent UTIs and hosp. for urosepsis - thought [**1-8**] to
chronic indwelling Foley catheter for neurogenic bladder. Last
admitted [**Date range (3) 35**] for urosepsis
3. Recurrent aspiration PNA - [**3-/2162**], [**10/2166**] - admitted both times
requiring MICU stay, during '[**65**] admission trach was placed
because was unable to clear secretions on her own [**1-8**] to
respiratory weakness
1/03 admitted for lingular PNA, unclear if [**1-8**] to aspiration
4. COPD
5. HTN
6. Osteoporosis
7. Scarlet fever as a child
8.  Chronic constipation
9. Hx of sacral decubitus ulcer

TTE on admission:
1. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal.
2. No obvious mass or vegetation seen.
.
CT abd post-op:
1) Large hematoma in the superficial tissues of the right upper
quadrant with associated edema and tracking into the abdominal
wall. No extension into the peritoneal space is seen. The
covering intern was notified by telephone at 10:30 a.m. on [**3-28**], [**2171**].

2) Gallbladder with dense material . this could represent
stones, sludge or vicarious excretion of iv contrast. If
clinically indicated, an ultrasound can be obtained for further
characterization.

3) Bilateral small kidneys with small nonobstructing stones.

4) Atelectasis and small pleural effusions at both lung bases.
.
EEG [**2172-3-28**]: This is a markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the

presence of generalized bursts of polymorphic disorganized
slowing
followed by periods of suppression. In addition, there were
independent
bifrontal sharp slow waves seen. This finding suggests deep,
midline
subcortical dysfunction and is consistent with a severe
encephalopathy.
A repeat EEG may be helpful to further evaluate the severity of
the encephalopathy.
.
EEG [**2172-3-31**]: This is an abnormal portable EEG obtained in stage
II sleep
with brief periods of drowsiness due to the presence of
intermittent and
independent shifting slowing in the parasagital region on both
sides.
This finding suggests deep, midline subcortical dysfunction and
is
consistent with the diagnosis of meningoencephalitis. In
addition,
exessive drowsiness was seen, perhaps also related to the
underlying
infection.
.
MRI [**4-4**]: Increased signal along the occipital horns could be
due to cellular debris from meningitis. No evidence of acute
infarct seen. Mild to moderate ventriculomegaly indicating mild
communicating hydrocephalus.
.
MRV [**4-4**]: The head MRV demonstrates normal flow signal in the
superior sagittal and transverse sinus without evidence of
thrombosis. Deep venous system also demonstrates normal flow
signal.
.
MRA [**4-4**]: Somewhat limited MRA of the head due to motion. No
evidence of vascular occlusion seen.
.
TEE:
1.The left atrium is normal in size.
2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4.There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
6.The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral
regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve.
7.There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
Head CT [**4-7**]: Stable appearance of the ventricles and sulci.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. GBS meningitis/bactermia
In the unit, the pt was continued on Ampicillin and started on
Gentamicin (for synergy). Her intrathecal baclofen pump was
thought to be infected (on exam, erythema and warmth overlying
pump in RUQ). Pt went to surgery to have pump removed and the
operation appeared to be without complication. The following
day, pt had 11 point hematocrit drop and was noted to be
hypotensive with an SBP of 70. After spiking a temp, it was
thought that she might be septic. She was given fluids, PRBCs,
FFP, and placed on Levophed. Abd CT demonstrated a 7 x 13x 11 cm
hematoma in the RUQ at the former pump site. Pt was taken
emergently to surgery where the hematoma was evacuated, slow
ooze noted, and the bleeding vessel cauterized. She returned to
the floor and remained hemodynamically stable. Given 1
additional unit of PRBCs. Her hct bumped appropriately and
remained in the high 20s for the rest of her unit course. Pt
developed erythematous macular rash on face, arms, knees thought
to be [**1-8**] to PCN allergy. Amp was d/c'd and replaced briefly
with Vanc and then changed permanently to Cefrtriaxone. Repeat
LP was performed since the pt continued to be minimially
responsive (withdrawing to pain, occ. opening eyes to name). CSF
analysis showed a resolving bacterial meningitis. Prior to
leaving the unit, pt spiked a temp to 101.2. She was pancultured
and all cultures were negative. A TTE ruled out endocarditis in
the setting of group B strep bacteremia.  On day #12 of
gentamycin, pt was changed to vanc/ceftaz for the completion of
her treatment course.
.
2. RUQ Hematoma: As above, after the removal of the baclofen
pump, pt had a hct drop and hypotensive episode and was found to
be bleeding into the RUQ pocket.  She was taken to the OR for
emergent evacuation of the hematoma.  On POD #16, pt was noted
to have oozing from the a site above the stitches in her RUQ.
Neurosurgery was reconsulted and they recommended an abdominal
ultrasound which showed vast improvement in the RUQ hematoma but
found a new fluid collection.  Surgery was consulted and they
diagnosed a seroma and recommended conservative management given
that it had no signs of infection.
.
3. Pneumonia:
Towards the end of the pt's ICU stay, she was evaluated by
speech and swallow and she had a very difficult time with the
passy-muir valve.  She underwent bronchoscopy and BAL was sent
for culture.  The culture returned positive for MRSA and gram
negative rods (not pseudomonas).  She was started on vancomycin
for MRSA and ceftaz/levaquin for double coverage of the GNR.
Once the GNR sensitivities showed that it was not pseudomonas,
ceftaz was stopped.  Of note, pt had vancomycin troughs that
were persistently high.  Vancomycin troughs should be checked
often and vanc should be adjusted for a level<15.  After the
pt's swallowing study, she was noted to have increased
secretions and some food particles were suctioned up so it was
assumed that the pt aspirated.  That day she also spiked a
temperature to 100 so Flagyl was added for anaerobic coverage.
Vancomycin and Levaquin will be finished on [**4-20**] (14-day course)
and Flagyl's course will be complete on [**4-24**] (after 10 days).
.
4. Supraglottic edema
As above, pt was evaluated by interventional pulmonary after she
failed a passy-muir valve.  On bronchoscopy it was noted that
she had severe supraglottic edema with grabulation tissue and
the vocal cords could only be minimally visualized.  She was
taken to the OR two days later for a rigid bronchoscopy where
her granulation tissue was debrided and a t-tube was placed.
ENT evaluated the patient and recommended a CT of the trachea to
evaluate her anatomy.  The CT showed tracheal bronchomalacia and
narrowing of the glottic and subglottic airway.  Ideally, she
will get surgery by ENT to improve her subglottic edema when the
patient has recovered from her acute illnesses.
.
5. Anemia: Iron studies indicate anemia of chronic disease.
Pt's baseline hct is between 26 and 29 and except for the hct
drop after the bleed in the RUQ pocket, pt's hct remained
stable.
.
6. Multiple sclerosis
Pt started on oral baclofen prior to pump removal. She was
without signs of baclofen withdrawal (i.e. incr HR, temp, BP,
seizures) once pump was removed. She continued on Baclofen 20mg
qid po with an Ativan taper. PO baclofen was then tapered to
20mg tid.
.
7. Mental status
At baseline, although pt is significantly debilitated by MS, she
is alert, oriented, and conversant. Her decreased responsiveness
was thought to be [**1-8**] to meningitis, but although pt seemed to
have resolving temp and WBC with Abx, her diminished
reponsiveness persisted. Repeat LP in the unit suggested a
resolving meningitis.  Neurology was following the pt and
recommended an MRI to rule out stroke (esp given her ? of stroke
at OSH) an MRV to rule out sinus thrombosis and an EEG to rule
out subclinical seizures.  An EEG on HD #3 was consistent with
severe encephalopathy and an EEG on HD #6 was consistent with
meningoencephalitis with no evidence of seizures.  An MRI was
finally done on HD #10 and showed mild communicating
hydrocephalus, no evidence of cavernous thrombosis or stroke.
Towards the end of her unit stay pt opened eyes to name and
eventually returned to her baseline mental status.  Pt's mental
status remained at baseline and pt will follow-up with neurology
as an outpatient.
.
8. Respiratory status
After a supposed seizure at OSH pt was mechanically ventilated
thru her trach site b/c no breath sounds were appreciated. (At
baseline, pt has respiratory weakeness 2/2 to multiple sclerosis
but does not require mechical ventilation. Trach in place to
help with clearance of secretions.)  Pt placed on A/C in unit,
then transferred to CPAP and eventually placed on a trach mask
with good results.  At time of discharge, she was satting well
on 40% trach mask.
.
9. HTN
In unit, pt initially normotensive, then mid-way through stay
became hypertensive with SBPs in the 150-170s. Pt has hx of
hypertension. Unclear whether BP was rebounding from baclofen
d/c. BP became well-controlled with systolic BP in the 90s-110s
on standing doses of Lisinopril 20mg po, Metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
10. Sacral decub ulcer: Stage 1-2.  Wound care nurse followed
while pt was in-house.
.
11. FEN: During pt's acute illness, she had an NGT placed.
Speech and swallow evaluated the pt and recommended thin liquids
and pureed food.  The following day, she was noted to have soup
coming out of her trach so she was again made NPO.  Pt then
passed the video swallow but again had some signs of aspiration
after trying some ground solids.  She was made NPO and GI placed
a PEG for feeding.  Pt should remain on tube feeds until her
tracheal swelling is much improved.  At that point, another
swallowing study can be performed and another trial of po
feeding.

History of Present Illness:
Pt. is an 83y/o F with a PMH of diverticulosis recently
discharged on [**2192-5-29**] s/p LGIB secondary to bleeding
diveriticulus admitted [**6-3**] with BRBPR.
.
During prior hospitalization pt. was admitted with a 2 week
history of BRBPR at home. On [**5-21**] a diverticular bleed found on
first colonoscopy, epi injected, but patient with continued LGIB
which was seen in the distal sigmoid on tagged RBC study [**5-24**].
The bleeding was not deemed amenable to angio intervention.
Repeat colonoscopy on [**5-25**] not able to identify further source of
bleeding. Pt discharged on [**5-29**] with a stable hct.
.
Since that time Pt. was doing well at home until she again had
an episode of BRBPR which she reported to fill the commode. Pt.

[**2192-6-5**]: GI Bleeding Study
INTERPRETATION: Following intravenous injection of autologous
red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic
images of the abdomen for minutes were obtained. A left lateral
view of the pelvis was also obtained at 90 minutes.
Blood flow images show no evidence of radiotracer extravasation.

Dynamic blood pool images show no evidence of radiotracer
extravasation.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of GI bleeding.

[**6-6**] Colonoscopy:
Findings:
 Mucosa: Normal mucosa was noted in the sigmoid colon,
descending colon, transverse colon and ascending colon.
 Excavated Lesions Multiple diverticula were seen throughout the
colon.There was no active bleeding noted.
Impression: Diverticulosis of the colon
Normal mucosa in the sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse
colon and ascending colon Otherwise normal colonoscopy to mid
ascending colon
Recommendations:
1. No active bleeding noted although pt could have bleed from
these diverticuli.
2. Follow serial Hct
3. If continues to bleed, need repeat bleeding scan/angio and
surgical consult.
Additional notes: 1. Procedure done with attending supervision.

[**2192-6-7**]: CXR INDICATION: Chest pain. Gastrointestinal bleed.
Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size. Vascular
pedicle has decreased in width and pulmonary vascularity appears
less engorged, consistent with overall improvement in volume
status of the patient. There are hazy areas of poorly defined
opacity in both upper lungs, right greater than left.
Differential diagnosis includes asymmetric edema versus focal
aspiration or infection. Small pleural effusions are unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt. is an 83y/o F with a PMH of diverticulosis recently
discharged on [**2192-5-29**] s/p LGIB secondary to bleeding
diveriticulus admitted [**6-3**] with BRBPR.

# Diverticulosis - During prior hospitalization pt. was admitted
with a 2 week history of BRBPR at home. On [**5-21**] a diverticular
bleed found on first colonoscopy, epi injected, but patient with
continued LGIB which was seen in the distal sigmoid on tagged
RBC study [**5-24**]. The bleeding was not deemed amenable to angio
intervention. Repeat colonoscopy on [**5-25**] not able to identify
further source of bleeding. Pt discharged on [**5-29**] with a stable
hct. Since that time Pt. was doing well at home until she again
had an episode of BRBPR which she reported to fill the commode
the day prior to admission. She was admitted to MICU for further
evaluation. In MICU pt. was transfused 2U PRBCs. Surgery
consulted and felt no acute intervention was needed. GI
consulted, deferred colonoscopy at this time. UA positive and
pt. started on cipro. B-blocker initially held due to bleeding,
restarted [**6-4**] at 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]. She had no further epsiodes of
bleeding and was deemed stable for transfer to the floor. After
transfer pt. had one episode of BRBPR. GI bleeding study was
completed but no source of bleeding localized. IR consulted and
felt she was not amendable to angiography at this time. Pt. also
seen by surgery who felt no acute procedure was needed. Pt. was
found to have a HCT of 30.1 and she was transfused an additional
2U PRBC with appropriate increase in HCT. Pt. had repeat
colonoscopy on [**2192-6-6**] which demonstrated diverticulum but no
clear source of bleeding. She had no further of episodes of
bleeding during admission. Her diet was advanced to regular and
was tolerated well. She had a stable HCT through the remainder
of her hospital stay and was deemed stable for discharge home.
Pt. developed loose stools the day prior to admission. First C.
diff toxin negative. Pt. had not having large volume diarrhea.
Repeat C. diff toxin sent prior to discharge and pt. informed to
contact PCP to follow up results as outpatient.
.
# UTI - Pt. had a positive UA on presentation to the ED. Her
culture was mixed flora. She was treated with a three day course
of cipro. Pt. was also found to have hematuria which was likely
caused by trauma secondary to foley insertion. She was advised
to follow up for further evaluation with PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 907**] UA prior to
discharge was negative for blood.
.
# Chest Discomfort - Pt. has history of mild NSTEMI from demand
ischemia from previous hospitalization for GI bleed. Echo
obtained showed LVOF obstruction in
setting of hyperdynamic state, mild-moderate MR, but no wall ASA
avoided given GI
recommendations. Patient was initially held on metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **]
but was restarted at 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**6-4**]. Pt. had occassional
complaints of vague chest discomfort with no changes on ECG. On
[**6-7**] pt. experience increased chest discomfort which was
relieved by 2SL NTG and 2mg morphine. She had no changes on ECG,
no changes on CXR and negative CEX2. She was found to be
tachycardic and her metoprolol was increased to previous home
dose of 25mg [**Hospital1 **] and then titrated up to 75mg [**Hospital1 **] for improved
HR. Pt. will follow up with cardiology as outpatient [**2192-6-12**].
.
She had no further of episodes of bleeding with a stable HCT and
was deemed stable for discharge home. She will follow up with
cardiology and her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was advised to call her PCP or [**Hospital **]
clinic if she has a recurrence of BRBPR and to return to ED.

After discharge pt. was found to have C. Diff positive result.
The patient's PCP was notified of this result.

Echo [**2198-11-26**]
Conclusions:
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Resting regional wall
motion abnormalities include inferior and inferolateral
akinesis/hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable
for review) of
[**2193-4-18**], left ventricular dysfunction is new and mild aortic
regurgitation
is now detected.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 63 yo male with cardiac arrest [**3-7**] paroxysmal high degree
AV block, s/p collapse with PEA arrest now with temp pacer
transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further mgmt and permanent pacemaker
placement.
.
1. Rhythm: paroxysmal high degree block, temp pacer placed.
reasons for initial collapse are unclear, possibly combination
of high degree av block and electrolyte disturbances, since
patient was on many K+sparing diuretics.  Tele after admission
showed V-paced with few PVCs.  Pt underwent pacemaker placement
on [**2198-11-26**] without complications.  The next day device
interrigation was satisfacotory.  CXR did not show a
pneumothorax or any acute processes.  Pt remained without
complaints and was discharged on [**2198-11-27**].  Indications for
pacer was symptomatic with high degree block.
.
2. Coronaries: risk factors, [**Location (un) 47**] risk 17%, ruled out for
MI w/trop leak but flat CKs after arrest. -Cont ASA, BB, statin
- lipids checked : total chol 122, HDL 36, LDL 68.  Continued on
lipitor 20.
- initially held ACEI given [**Doctor First Name 48**] upto Creatinine of 2.2.  Given
his hyperkalemia on presentation pt was not restarted on ACE
inhibitors as his BP was well controlled.
- Repeat Echo (see below) showed EF of 50%.  Given this event
would recommend an outpatient evaluation by cardiologist for
likely exercise stress test.
.
3. Pump: EF [**2193**] was 60% w/LAE, likely diastolic dysfunction,
mild hypervolemia w/?mild pulm edema causing mild hypoxia,
initially gentle diuresis with goals -500cc to -1L.
- Continued amlodipine and metoprolol for rate control
- held ace/arbs due to [**Doctor First Name 48**]
- echo [**11-26**] showed EF of 50%.
- During the admission pt did not go onto complain any further
of Chest pain or Shortness of breath.
.
4. ARF/CRI: acute insult likely combo of triamterene and NSAIDS,
aggrevated by diuretics and ACE-I. Baseline 1.3-1.5 with
proteinuria long standing, should avoid NSAIDS for life.
-Discontinued ACE-I/ARBa and diuretics.
-Checked FeUrea, FeUrea: 36.5%, confirming ATN. spep and upep
(given anemia, pending), had u/s at [**Hospital1 46**] but should have
repeat as outpt to check complex cysts vs masses. Renal diet.
.
5. Anemia: new,  SPEP was negative, UPEP negative for bence
[**Doctor Last Name 49**] proteins,  and iron, shows anemia likely due to renal
causes
-PCP may consider [**Name9 (PRE) 50**] as outpt given pt's age and anemia.
.
6. Thombocytopenia: new, mild and stable during the admission.
.
7. Elevated glucose: possibly continued stress response, check
FS wnl.
.
8. h/o hypokalemia:  PCP may consider Nephrologist follow up.
Would Recommend outpt mineralocorticoid XS work-up once off K
sparing diuretics for a while.
.
9. Hip pain: awaiting THR. vicodin prn. No NSAIDs due to renal
problems.

Discharge Instructions:
You have had a pacemaker placed because of electrical block in
your heart. This may have been precipitated by kidney failure
and too much potassium in your blood. Do not take the
medications you were taking prior to this event. We have
enclosed a list of and prescriptions for your new medication
needs. Please take these as directed and discuss any changes
with your primary care doctor.
.
You have many risks for coronary heart disease. We feel you need
a stress test with imaging in the next month to make sure that
you do not have any significant need for a cardiac
catheterization. Until then, taking aspirin, your Toprol XL
(beta blocker safe in renal failure), your lipitor, and
eventually starting your lisinopril again will protect you
somewhat from heart attacks.
.
You must never take NSAID medications again. Your kidney disease
makes this dangerous. Avoid ibuprofen, advil, motrin, aleve,
naproxen, or ketoprofen. Talk with your doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 57**] if
you are unsure about any medications you are taking.


Followup Instructions:
1. See your primary care doctor Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 58**] on Friday 28th at
2:30pm, to check your potassium and creatinine levels and to
discuss everything we recommended. Have your doctor follow up on
the serum and urine protein electrophoresis that was pending
when you were discharged as well as the final report of your
echocardiogram. Talk with your doctor about your anemia and
whether or not you would need a bone marrow biopsy.

2. Go to the pacemaker DEVICE CLINIC Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 59**]
Date/Time:[**2198-12-3**] 11:30

3. You should see our nephrologists sometime for your kidney
disease. Talk with your primary doctor about this and call for
an appointment [**Telephone/Fax (1) 60**].

4. You should also setup an appointment with a cardiologist to
have a exercise stress test done as outpatient.  You can speak
with your PCP regarding [**Name Initial (PRE) **] cardiologist or you can call [**Hospital 61**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 62**] to setup an appointment here.

Single AP view of the chest is obtained [**2102-4-15**] at 10:30 hours
and compared with the prior radiograph of [**2102-4-13**] at 14:20 hours.
Patient has been extubated and chest tubes have been removed as
has a right-sided Swan-Ganz catheter. Patient is status post
cardiac surgery. Increased retrocardiac density in the left side
with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm persists and is
consistent with postsurgical atelectasis in the left base. Small
left pleural effusion may also be present. In the upper abdomen
there is colon interposition on the right side.

IMPRESSION:
1. Thickening and ill-definition of the right brachial plexus
just lateral to the superior ribs and inferior to the
subscapularis muscle immediately below the coracoid process,
likely secondary to trauma. No mass or hematoma impinging upon
the nerves within the axilla or medially. The appearance of the
nerves as they course by the proximal humeral shaft fracture is
not well evaluated on this study as it is too peripheral.
2. Humeral shaft fracture and hemorrhage within the subcoracoid

HAND (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) RIGHT  [**2134-2-16**] 5:46 PM
THREE VIEWS OF THE RIGHT HAND: There is diffuse osseous
demineralization. There are degenerative changes with no
definite fracture. Joint spaces are preserved.
THREE VIEWS OF THE RIGHT WRIST: Alignment is normal. No
fractures are identified. There are multiple rounded calcific
bodies in the dorsal soft tissues that do not appear to be
fracture fragments.
THREE VIEWS OF THE RIGHT ELBOW: Alignment is normal. No
fractures are identified. There is an enthesophyte at the
posterior olecranon.
.
C-spine CT: There is no evidence of cervical spine fracture.
Bulky
calcifications of the posterior longitudinal ligament are
identified at the C2-4 levels, likely resulting in moderate
spinal stenosis.  Multilevel degenerative changes are identified
with disc space and osteophyte formation. Bridging osteophytes
are identified at C7-T2.  The T1-3 processes appear fused.
There is marked irregularity of the inferior endplate of T3 and
superior endplate of T4 with impaction of these vertebral bodies
onto each other and acute kyphotic angulation at this level.
These findings are likely chronic.  There is no prevertebral
soft tissue swelling.  The lung apices are clear.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cervical spine fracture.  Extensive
degenerative changes as described above.
.
Head CT: FINDINGS:  There is hyperdensity along the left frontal
vertex that is likely secondary to volume averaging.  There is
no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect,
hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures or major
vascular territorial infarction.  Hypodensity in the
periventricular cerebral white matter is consistent with chronic
microvascular ischemia. Small prior infarcts are identified in
the right internal capsule basal ganglia and left external
capsule.  Surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
.
Bilateral Hip films: Degenerative changes with no definite
fracture.
.
CTA: Impression:
1. no PE
2. enlarged pulmonary arteries
3. lymphadenopathy in mediastinum some of which are calcified
4. calcified hilar lymph nodes

Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function
are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion
appears normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Summary:
Briefly, this is a 81 year old Russian speaking woman who
presented status post fall.  No intracranial bleed. No hip
fracture. + R humerus fracture. CT of c-spine showed severe
stenosis. She was initially admitted to the medicine service for
workup of syncope; neurology was consulted for a weak right arm
following R humeral fracture and she was found to have a mixed
central cord and Brown-Sequard syndrome and transferred to the
neurology service for closer exam monitoring.  She underwent  R
humerus ORIF and C2-C6 laminectomy and fusion on [**2134-3-2**]. A med
consult was obtained on [**2134-3-4**] for persistent hypoxia. She was
gently diuresed, and had serial ABG's which showed persistent
hypercarbia. During the admission, she was also treated with
Cipro for a UTI.
.
Neuro: The patient could not recall the events surrounding the
fall and sustained a spiral fracture to the right proximal
humerus, displaced, and had bilateral arm weakness and numbness
distally in all 4 extremities.  On exam she initially was found
to have evidence of a central cord syndrome with weakness
affecting arms more so than legs.  She also had evidence of a
brown sequard given that weakness and proprioception are down on
the right with an upgoing toe, and pin sensation is down on the
left, sensory level of C4/T3 anteriorly on the left (where the
two dermatomes meet at the top of the breast).  She was
complaining of neck pain, and had had trouble voiding so a foley
was placed.
.
MRI of the C-spine was performed for the likelihood of acute
spinal cord injury with above findings.  Read of MRI was: ""Bulky
ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament at C2/3,
C3/4, and C4/5 levels, more than the right, causing severe
spinal canal stenosis.The cervical cord at those levels is
deformed and compressed, demonstrating intrinsic T2 hyperintense
signal.  There is also a fracture at the inferior endplate of C3
anteriorly.""  She was placed in a hard cervical collar and pain
was controlled with morphine and ibuprofen initially.  She was
seen by both neurosurgery and orthopedics for the injury as both
services had been alternately covering the spine service in the
hospital.  Orthopedics also followed her for the broken right
humerus, and neurosurgery had initially been consulted in the ED
when a head ct showed the question of a subdural hematoma (later
proven to be artifactual).
.
Both [**Date Range **] and neurosurgery agreed that it was safest for the
patient to hold off on the spine surgery for at least a week to
allow cord swelling to heal before operating.  She remained in a
hard collar during this time and her exam improved over the next
week; the pinprick sensory level retracted to the T12 region for
days, then finally seemed to vanish altogether; the
proprioceptive changes on the right also resolved.  Although the
right arm remained weak and flaccid with just [**2-28**] finger flexors
and trapezius/shoulder shrug [**2-28**] (initially thought just limited
by pain versus multiple nerve injury), the left arm strength
improved to deltoid [**3-31**], [**Hospital1 **]/tri both 4+ to 5-/5, and wrist and
finger extensors 4+/5; finger flexors were also 4+/5.  On [**4-9**]: there were no changes in exam.  For neuropathic pain,
neurontin had been initiated (patient later requested d/c to
simplify med regimen).
.
The weekend of [**2-27**] on morning rounds, a mild right Horner's
syndrome was noted which had not been picked up before on daily
rounds.  This, along with the flaccid arm, was suggestive of
root avulsion on the right (and associated plexopathy).
Her neurologic symptoms all gradually resolved during
hospitalization.
.
[**Date Range 1957**]:
Pt underwent R humerus ORIF and cervical laminectomy (report
below), however pt post-op, the medicine service was consulted
for hypoxia (pt required 50% shovel mask) and hypercarbia (pCO2
in high 50's). She has a follow up appointment on [**3-18**] with
[**Month/Year (2) **] to evaluate her fracture and decide whether her C-collar
can be removed.
.
Hypoxia/hypercarbia:
Pt had hx of severe pulm HTM, likely [**1-28**] PDA. ABG showed mild
CO2 retention, ? if this was close to her baseline. Also likely
had component of fluid overload, given recent surgery.  Pt was
gently diuresed with IV Lasix. Narcotics were d/c'd as pt
appeared somnolent. O2 was successfully weaned down to 2L NC (pt
apparently had been on 2L O2 at home). CTA on admission was
negative for PE, and the suspicion for PE was fairly low post-op
given that the pt was not tachycardic and her oxygen requirement
improved.  Therefore, repeat CTA was not done. She was also
noted to be hypercarbic during admission, but her respiratory
status remained stable while on the medicine service.
.
Status post fall: The original fall was of unclear etiology. The
differential included vasovagal syncope versus new onset
afib/atach versus mechanical given loss of consciousness. Less
likely include myocardial infarction/ischemia versus pulmonary
embolism versus seizure. Also less likely hypoglycemia given
timing after meal although patinet on glyburide which is renally
cleared in setting of increased creatinine.  The patient ruled
out for MI by cardiac enzymes, echo showed no obvious severe
valvular disease to explain ?syncopal event, though telemetry
showed periodic tachyarrhythmia ?sinus tach vs afib.  She had no
other significant tele events while in the hospital.
.
Elevated WBC and lactate at admission: unclear etiology,
afebrile with negative UA and infectious workup at admission.
This cleared on its own.  Later in hospitalization ([**2-27**]) she had
a UTI treated with course of ciprofloxacin. Urine cxlood cx, and
cath tip cx were sent prior to d/c to workup somnolence, however
pt's somnolence cleared and cx's were pending on d/c. These
should be followed at her follow up appointments.
.
Musculoskeletal: initially, radiographic imaging was negative
for fracture or bleed including right UE, hips bilaterally,
c-spine and head. Patient with known chronic low back pain and
sciatica.
.
Hypertension/pulmonary hypertension: continued ASA, held
valsartan. lasix initially held for renal failure but was
restarted once she was clinically stable.
.
Hypercholesterolemia: continued home dose of lipitor
.
Renal: She has slight renal insufficiency at admission and was
given gentle IVF. Her electrolytes were followed and repleted as
needed, MVI and continued niferex.  ARF improved. She should
have her potassium and BUN/creatinine followed at regular
intervals starting 2-3 days post discharge, as she was
discharged on her home dose of [**Last Name (un) **] and new dose of lasix.

Prophylaxis: The patient was maintained on TEDS, SQ heparin,
PPI, bowel regimen.  She complained of RLE pain one day, and u/s
was ordered to r/o dvt - this study was negative.

PROCEDURE:  IM nail right humerus.

ASSISTANT:  [**Last Name (un) 1965**].

INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 81-year-old
woman who sustained a fall and has a displaced right proximal
humerus fracture. She also has a spine injury and this has
been operated on by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1966**]. Given the displacement of
her fracture and that she is having pain and not tolerating
nonoperative treatment, we decided to proceed with
intramedullary nailing.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  After informed consent was
obtained and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1967**] had completed his spinal portion
of the case, the patient was placed in the supine position.
The right arm was prepped and draped in normal sterile
fashion.

A 3 cm incision was made over the proximal humerus and the
deltoid was split. Eentry point was established in the
proximal humerus and the guide wire placed. The fracture was
held reduced and the guide wire passed into the distal
humerus. The proximal part of the humerus was reamed and
then the canal was reamed up to a size 10 mm. Next a 230 by
10 mm [**Doctor Last Name 1968**] and Nephew nail was placed and interlocked with 2
screws proximally. The distal locking screw was placed under
image intensification. Wounds were irrigated and closed with
0 Vicryl, 2-0 and a subcuticular 3-0. Postoperatively, she
was brought back to the recovery room in stable condition.

COMPLICATIONS:  None.

As the attending surgeon I was present for and performed the
entire procedure.

As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged
evidence
of mild bilateral hilar enlargement, potentially due to hilar
lymphadenopathy or enlarged pulmonary arteries.  Minimal
atelectasis at the left lung base and along the minor fissure.
No evidence of pneumonia, no pulmonary edema.  No pleural
effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 939**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] Spine Surgery Service on
[**2179-5-24**] and taken to the Operating Room for L2-S1 interbody
fusion through an anterior approach.

# Lumbar spondylosis, scoliosis, and stenosis.
Please refer to the dictated operative note for further details.
The surgery was without complication and the patient was
transferred to the PACU in a stable condition. TEDs/pneumoboots
were used for postoperative DVT prophylaxis. Intravenous
antibiotics were given per standard protocol. Initial postop
pain was controlled with a PCA. On HD#2 she returned to the
operating room for a scheduled L2-S1 decompression with PSIF as
part of a staged 2-part procedure. Please refer to the dictated
operative note for further details. The second surgery was also
without complication and the patient was transferred to the
T/SICU in a stable condition. Postoperative HCT was 25 and she
was given 2 units PRBCs.  She was maintained on strict supine
bedrest for 48 hours given the small dural tear that was noted.
She was kept NPO until bowel function returned then diet was
advanced as tolerated. The patient was transitioned to oral pain
medication when tolerating PO diet. Foley was removed on POD#3
from the second procedure. She was fitted with a lumbar
warm-n-form brace for comfort. Physical therapy was consulted
for mobilization OOB to ambulate.

#) Delirium:
During her post-operative course, the patient was noted to be
confused and disoriented, prompting transfer to medicine for
further management of her delirium.  This was felt to be
possibly as secondary to narcotic medication and lingering
effects of anesthesia.  Infectious etiologies were ruled out and
the patient underwent an ABG which did not reveal evidence of
hypoventilation.  Her mental status improved significantly and
she was awake, alert, oriented x3 and long longer confused prior
to discharge.

#) Pain control:
The patient was intially maintained on a fentanyl PCA and this
was transitioned to oral pain medications with good control
prior to discharge.  She was followed by the chronic pain
service given her history of multiple medication allergies.  She
is to be discharged on tramadol, topiramate, and aceaminophen.

#) Anemia
Patient's baselined hematocrit was felt to be approximately 40
(from [**2179-4-24**]).  She required PRBC transfusions given
intraoperative blood [**Last Name (un) 940**].  Her hematocrit remained stable upon
discharge (28-29).

CHRONIC PROBLEMS

Pertinent Results:
CT head:
Extensive bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage. Recommend head CTA
to evaluate for an intracranial aneurysm.
Findings were discussed with Dr.

CTA:
FINDINGS: There is a 3 mm x 3 mm saccular outpouching from the
region of the anterior communicating artery (2:317), consistent
with aneurysm. This has a very narrow neck, and would be
amenable to endovascular intervention. No other aneurysm or
vascular abnormality is seen.
There is stenosis at the origin of the right vertebral artery.
Otherwise, the carotid and vertebral arteries and their major
branches are patent, with no evidence of stenosis or occlusion.
The distal cervical internal carotid arteries measure 5 mm on
the right, and 5 mm on the left.
Mild-to-moderate multilevel cervical spine degenerative changes
are noted.
IMPRESSION: 3 mm saccular aneurysm arising from the anterior
communicating
artery, with narrow neck.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 83**] was admited on [**2175-3-12**] and became increasingly
lethargic and transferred to the ICU for further care under the
Neurosurgery service. A diagnostic CTA revealed a large ACOM
aneursym which was coiled the following day.

Post Coiling the pt. was admitted to the ICU with a ventricular
drain. There were no incidences of increased intracranial
pressure or decline. A cerebral perfusion study performed [**3-15**]
confirmed the lack of vasospasm and develoing strokes.

He had some R shoulder weakness and shoulder X-ray was
concerning for rotator cuff injury and orthopedics was
consulted.

On [**2179-3-16**]/14/15 his ventricular drain was clamped and reopened
due to elevated ICP levels. On [**3-19**] he was transferred to the
SDU and continued to remain stable.  He had his ventricular
drain clamped on [**3-21**] and after 48 hours of the clamping trial
he had a CT done which was stable without any evidence of
hydrocephalus. At this time the drain was pulled.

He was placed on a fluid restriction for a brief period of time
for a drop in his Na level, and also on salt tabs, upon
discharge to rehab we have removed the fluid restriction, but we
are continuing the salt tabs, we advise that the Na level be
checked every other day, and the salt tabs may be d/c'ed when Na
is stable on serial checks. Upon discharge his Na is 138.

He is now ready for discharge to rehab.

On discharge his exam is as follows:

Alert and Oriented X2
Moving all extremities with full strength
slight Right Drift, which has been persistant throughout his
hospitalization, and possibly secondary to a rotator cuff
injury.

Pertinent Results:
CT head [**2199-1-22**]:
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or major cortical
territorial infarction.

CXR [**2199-1-22**]:
: New right lower lobe confluent opacity which may represent a
developing area of pneumonia. Differential diagnosis includes
aspiration and
atelectasis. Dedicated PA and lateral chest radiograph is
suggested for more
complete characterization when the patient's condition permits.

no contrast head CT [**2199-1-28**]
 FINDINGS: There has been interval development of an area of
decreased attenuation at the left basal ganglia and
periventricular white matter in the distribution of the left
lenticulostriate artery consistent with a subacute infarct.
There is associated swelling with mass effect on the left
lateral ventricle. There is no shift of normally midline
structures. Additional areas of hypodensity in the
periventricular white matter and right centrum semiovale are
unchanged and consistent with old infarctions. Two calcified
meningiomas are again seen arising at the left frontal dura and
anterior olfactory groove. They are unchanged from prior study.
No intracranial hemorrhage was identified. Surrounding osseous
and soft-tissue structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Subacute left lenticulostriate infarction which was
not present on head CT of [**2199-1-22**]

echo [**2199-1-28**]:

The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular  hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal  technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.  Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is a
severe resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right
ventricular  chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve is not well  seen. There is probably mild aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is  seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral  regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
There is a significant  left ventricular inflow gradient which
may be due to mitral annular  calcification and mitral valve
calcification. The tricuspid valve leaflets are  mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

LENI [**2199-1-24**]:
No evidence of thrombus within the right upper extremity

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted with hypernatremia and acute mental status
changes and right sided paralysis. Her corrected sodium on
admission was about 170s and her free water deficit was 5.5L.
She was volume repleted with normal saline. She also recieved
D51/4 NS for free water repletion initially and this was changed
to free water boluses through nasogastric tube. Her sodium
gradually trended down with free water repletion. She also was
in pre-renal renal failure and her creatinine trended down with
hydration.

With regards to the acute mental changes, this is partially
explained by the hypernatrmic state. However, she was also noted
by the nursing home to have right sided weakness. CT head was
performed on admission which was negative for stoke. Neurology
was consulted and found that she has a MCA territory stroke by
exam. A repeat CT head was performed on [**1-28**] which showed
watershed infarct. TTE which was also obtained did not reveal
any thrombus.Per neurology recommendation, all her hypertensive
medication has been discontinued and she was started on aspirin.


Chest XRay on admission was concerning for right lower lobe
pneumonia. Her sputum culture grew MSSA for which she was on
oxacillin. Levofloxacin was also started for community acquired
pneumonia. Nasal aspirate was sent for influenza and was
negative. She was intubated on [**2199-1-24**] for increased respiratory
effort. Her resporatory decompensation was likely from
aspiration pneumonia. She was extubated on [**2199-1-31**] when her
lungs mechanic improved. However, given her  depressed mental
status and stroke, she was not able to clear her secretions
well. SHe was intubated again on [**2-2**] after unsuccessful attempt
to maintain her oxygen saturation with high flow mask. She
recieved tracheostomy and G tube and tolerated well post
procedure.

Her  nutrition status was maintained by tubefeeds and insulin
sliding scale and NPH kept her glucose within range.

Her blood pressure was initially low on admission. This
responded well to hydration and brief use of levophed. Her [**Last Name (un) 104**]
stimulation test was responsive. Admission EKG showed ST
depression in V2-V3 and it was unsure if this is old. She had
slightly elevated troponin, likely from acute renal failure
which eventually trending down.

Plastic surgery was consulted for decubitus ulcer. No
debridement was indicated and their recommendation was to
maxmize nutrition, wet to dry dressing and tight glucose
control.

She remained on sc heparin, lansoprazole, pneumoboots and bowel
regimen as part of her porphylaxis. She had picc line placed
upon discharge

THere had been multiple discussion with her daughter, which is
her health care proxy regarding code status. It was felt by the
medical team that her condition will not likely improve despite
optimal medical treatment. However, due to religious reasons,
her family remained steadfast that everything should be done.
However, her family agrees that should she go into cardiac
arrest, there should be no chest compression or defibrillation.

Pertinent Results:
Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**4-/2174**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Limited coronary angiography demonstrated heavily calcified
left
main, left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries. The
left circumflex had a heavily calcified proximal lesion.
2. LV ventriculography was deferred.
3. Successful Rotational atherectomy, PTCA and stenting of the
proximal left circumflex artery with a Cypher (3x13mm) drug
eluting stent postdilated to 3.5mm. Final angiography
demonstrated no
angiographically apparent dissection, no residual stenosis and
TIMI III flow throughout the vessel (See PTCA Comments).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful rotational atherectomy, PTCA and stenting of the
proximal LCX with a drug eluting stent (Cypher).
.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2174-5-20**] demonstrated:The left
atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and moderate global hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35 %).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.7cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**12-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing,
the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a very small circumferential pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe aortic valve stenosis. Moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with moderate global hypokinesis.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

pericardial effusion without evidence of hemodynamic compromise
with a prominent anterior fat pad.
.
[**6-6**] EKG - Sinus tachycardia. Left atrial abnormality. Left
bundle-branch block.
Left axis deviation. Secondary repolarization abnormalities.
Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2174-6-4**] heart rate has increased. Otherwise,
no major
change.
.
CXRs over the course of admission showed slowly improving
pulmonary edema, no major focal consolidations were seen.
.
Renal US - no hydronephrosis, patent renal artery.

Brief Hospital Course:
# PUMP/Chronic systolic congestive heart failure:
Patient presented with presumed acute exacerbation of chronic
systolic heart, which has improved after ultrafiltration. [**Date Range **]
with EF of 30-40% unchanged from prior. She currently appears
fairly euvolemic, however her fluid status has remained
difficult to manage given her low ejection fraction and poor
urine output.
- Continued home doses of carvedilol and losartan.  Were held
initially for low blood pressures, but both restarted during her
admission.
- Hemodialysis was considered for fluid managment, but a trial
of lasix proved successful.  She will now go home on 160 mg PO
daily lasix and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 118**], her nephrologist.
She will monitor daily weights/low sodium diet, pt had nutrition
consult during stay.
.
# CAD: No evidence ACS during hospitalization. Patient is s/p
recent LCx stent.  She was continued on ASA, carvedilol, plavix,
and Losartan.

.
#. Valves. No active issues. Severe AS a/p valvuloplasty
[**2174-5-11**], stable AS per [**Month/Day/Year **]. Discussed with patient and family:
per their report, patient was previously evaluated by Dr.
[**Name (NI) 137**] in cardiac surgery and was not a candidate for valve
replacment due to ""calcifications."" Patient may be candidate for
new cath-assisted valve replacement. Also has mild MR on last
[**Name (NI) 113**].  Pt should likely be re-evaluated after discharge.
.
# Respiratory distress resolved -
Respiratory distress was suspected to be likely multifactorial
secondary to volume overload and also PNA as supported by
elevated WBC on presentation, fever, and now GNR in sputum gram
stain but not growing on culture. Increased sputum overnight
while afebrile, non-elevated white count likely represents
resolving infection. Received monotherapy with ceftazadime only
given GNR in sputum may be pseudomonas; antibiotics started
[**5-29**], continued for 7 days.  She will continue lasix as
outpatient to try and prevent pulm edema.
.
# ANEMIA/GIB:
HCT drop was noted several two days into admission, unclear if
represented true blood loss. NGT removed [**5-31**] and this
demonstrated frank dark blood (+hemoccult) in NGT, likely
representing bleed several days ago from gastritis. LDH and
haptoglobin were checked with HCT drop and were within normal
limits which is inconsistent with hemolysis. She received 1 u
PRBCs soon after admission, and HCT has remained stable since.
Her Hcts were between 26 and 28.  Stools were checked for guiac,
and were positive two days prior to dicharge.  We discharged her
home with protonix and recommend follow up with her PCP to
continue to monitor CBCs for watch for blood loss.  She is not
actively losing blood as seen by her stable Hcts.  We also
recommend an outpatient colonoscopy.  Although, she needs to be
very careful with the bowel prep, as that can cause large fluid
shifts and drive her into pulmonary edema.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure (stable Cr):
Acute on chronic renal failure likely due to ATN secondary to
hypotension versus ongoing pre-renal state. Patient had been
initiated on HD in [**2174-3-15**]; was taken off HD ~1 week prior to
admission. Volume overload/CHF on admission, improved with UF,
now appears euvolemic. Creatinine 1.... on discharge.  Pt has
history of RCC with nephrectomy.  Renal function has seemed to
normalize.  Will continue follow up with nephrologist and he
will also coordinate removal of dialysis catheter.

#  Pt was discharge to home with services for PT and home health
care for dialysis catheter dressing changes.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for respiratory distress due to fluid in your
lungs from an acute episode of worsening heart failure.  You
were intubated at the time, and when you were able to breath on
your own, we continued to remove fluid from your lungs with
diuretics.  We also are continuing to give you the medicines
carvedilol and losartan for your heart failure.

You also will start taking lasix daily to ensure fluid stays off
your lungs.

In addition, you had acute renal failure during this admission.
Your kidney function improved, but you will continue to need
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 118**].  You also have a dialysis catheter in
your chest that will need to be taken care of by a home nurse.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 118**] will discuss removal of the catheter as an
outpatient.

We also found a trace amount of blood in your stool.  You should
meet with your PCP and discuss having a colonoscopy.  Make sure
to tell them you have heart failure because it does affect the
bowel preparation they plan for you.

Once at home, weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight >
3 lbs.
Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet.  Call the nutritionist with any
questions.

Also, if you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest

History of Present Illness:
82yo Russian speaking F with a PMH of type II DM, HTN,
hyperlipidemia, obesity, pulmonary HTN and anemia, who presented
to the ED this AM with worsening SOB x 2 weeks. Per the ED
resident, the patient noted that she had had worsening SOB x 2
weeks (documented as 2 days [**Name8 (MD) **] RN note) and also complained of
orthopnea and increasing lower extremity swelling and weeping
from a venous stasis ulcer on her L shin. The patient was able
to communicate this verbally to ER resident (RN notes she was
only able to speak in 4 word sentences). Her VNA stated that she
was only 94% on 2L O2 at home and had rales [**12-28**] way up
bilaterally. On initial assessment in the [**Hospital1 18**] ER, her vital
signs were T 98.2, BP 167/60, HR 61, RR 23, sats 100% on RA. On
next assessment (2 hrs later), pt was felt to be very SOB while
attempting to use the bed pan. RN noted her to be dusky,
diaphoretic. HR 72, RR 28, sats 90% on RA. She was placed on a
NRB with improvement in her O2 sats to 98%. BP rose to 210/74,
then 215/93. CXR was taken and read as c/w pneumonia. Blood cx
were obtained and ceftriaxone was administtered. 90 mins later,
she was felt to be diaphoretic again, with increased work of
breathing. Her O2 sats dropped to 90% by NRB and she was prepped
for intubation. She was given 2mg versed and was intubated. SBP
210 -> 178 -> 130. She was taken to CT scan for CTA. On return
from CT scan, she was felt to be bucking the vent. She was given
fentanyl 100mcg, with resultant drop in her SBP to 77. She was
then bolused 1L of NS with improvement in her SBP to 96. She was
also given vecuronium 10mg IV and ativan 1mg IV because of
inability to ventilate and biting at the tube.
.
On review, she was given: 1gm CTX IV x1, ? azithromcyin 500mg IV
x1, lasix 20mg x1, 120mg succinylcholine IV, etomidate 20mg IV,
12.5mg versed IV, and fentanyl 100mcg x1. She was also given 1

Brief Hospital Course:
1) RESPIRATORY FAILURE:
Most likely explanation is acute diastolic CHF (""flash""
pulmonary edema) given acute onset and associated HTN.  No
evidence of structural heart disease on echo. ? findings of PNA,
and unclear what to make of other findings on CTA--lymphoma vs
TB. Pt does have an elevated LDH, but it was felt these were
unlikely possibilities.  Pt was treated for CHF with diuresis
and improved.  She was extubated and respiratory status
continued to improve fitting with CHF as the etiology.  She
should have a repeat CT to evaluate the lymphadenopathy.  She
was also empirically treated with pneumonia with azithro but she
was afebrile with nml WBC.  She was continued on losartan, beta
blockade.
.
2) CV:  As above.  Continued on aspirin.  No evidence of acute
ischemia.
.
3) ANEMIA, iron deficiency:
Baseline Hct 28-30, at baseline on discharge. On niferex as an
outpatient. Iron studies checked at last visit--Fe/TIBC ~15%.
Continued on iron for iron deficieny.
.
4) HTN: Contine Metoprolol, [**Last Name (un) **]

ECG:  Sinus rhythm at 76 bpm with evidence of RVH, normal axis
and intervals, no ST-T changes.
.
Imaging:
[**2136-4-4**] Chest x-ray:
FINDINGS: Portable AP upright chest radiograph is obtained.
Evaluation is somewhat limited by underpenetrated technique.
There is no definite evidence of pneumonia. Heart size is
stable. Pulmonary arterial prominence is noted compatible with
patient's given history of pulmonary hypertension.
Atherosclerotic calcification at the aorta is noted. There is no
pneumothorax. Diffuse demineralized bone is noted with
post-surgical changes of the right proximal humerus.
.
Abdominal CT:Large right rectus muscle hematoma approximately
10.1x4.4x15.2 cm.
.
Echocardiogram on [**2136-3-26**]:
The left atrial volume is markedly increased (>32ml/m2). The
left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity
imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic
dysfunction. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 84 year-old female with a history of pulmonary
hypertension, diastolic CHF, who presented with weakness,
hypotension, Guaiac positive stools.
.

# Hypotension - Her hypotension and anemia were felt to be due
to blood loss from rectus sheath hematoma.  Unknown exactly how
the hematoma occurred (?secondary to heparin injection while
recently hospitalized)but was well visualized on the abdominal
CT that she had in the ER.  She was evaluated by GI (due to
anemia and guaiac positive stools), who found external
hemorrhoids on exam and stated there was little or no concern
regarding duodenal angioectasia as source of hematocrit drop.
They followed and plans for c-scope if she started bleeding
again.   Her Hct was 22 on admission, microcytic.  She received
3 units of blood in total and her hematocrit stablized at 29-30
for several days.  Her blood pressure was 80/40 on admission and
she was admitted to the MICU, but did not require pressors, her
BP increased with blood and fluids (2L).  In the ICU she was on
a po PPI, had two large bore IVs, as well as central access.
Her Hct was checked q6 hours and transfusion parameter was 26.
Her aspirin was held.  Her BP increased to teens over 80's and
she was transferred to the medical floor after one day in the
MICU.  On the medical floor her blood pressure remained in the
120's/80's initially but then increased to 140's.  Her
lisinopril, valsartan, metoprolol and furosemide were held
initially due to her relatively low blood pressure and increased
creatinine (see below). Her furosemide was restarted on the last
day of hospitalization due to blood pressure that would tolerate
it and signs of hypervolemia.
In addition she had several bowel movements on the day prior to
admission, likely due to many laxatives she was receiving.  She
did not have a  leukocytosis, fever.  The stool was guiaic
negative.  Her laxatives were discontinued except docusate.
.
# Acute renal failure - Pre-renal secondary to
hypotension/hypovolemia.  C Her electrolytes and volume status
were stable.  Her lisinopril, lasix and valsartan were held and
continue to be held as her blood pressure is in the 130's.  Her
creatinine was 3.4 on admission with a baseline of 1.6.  Her
creatinine decreased to 1.4 after hydration and her lasix was
restarted at her home dose of 80mg po bid.
.
# Leukocytosis - WBC on admission was very high, likely
reactive, given hypotension, and acute blood loss.  Blood and
urine cultures were negative and she had no diarrhea.  Her CXR
was unremarkable and antibiotics were deferred as there was no
source of infection, she was afebrile and her leukocytosis
resolved (WBC was 7 for the last two days of admission).
.
# Hyperlipidemia - She continued to take atorvastatin
.
# Chronic pain - She continued to take gabapentin
.
# Diabetes mellitus - insulin sliding scale while in house, once
creatinine normalized glipizide 2.5mg q daily was re-started.

Brief Hospital Course:
After initial presentation to the ED, patient was admitted to
the surgical intensive care unit under the direct care of Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. In the ED, patient became hypotensive requiring liters
of IVF, oxygen 4LNC administered, started on Levophed 0.1 mg,
central line was place, Levofloxacin and Flagyl intravenously
were started for leukocytosis. Blood, urine and stool cultures/c
Diff sent. CT scan was obtained and revealed; severe colonic
wall thickening involving ascending, transverse, and descending
colon, less pronounced sigmoid and rectum. The pancolitis
picture was suggestive of pseudomembranous colitis.
.
ICU Course HD2-HD4: HD2, patient remained on Levophed and
insulin drips, receiving fluid resuscitation with lactated
ringers, leukocytosis increasing from 12 to 25, bandemia,
antibiotic coverage was levofloxacin and Flagyl. Abdomen was
more distended, no tenderness, adequate urine output and organ
perfusion, KUB revealed edematous colon but no dilation,
multiple episodes of liquid green stool, specimen for C. Diff
was positive. HD3, WBC trending down, Levophed slowly weaned
off, abdomen less distended, minimally tender in lower
quadrants. HD4, chest x-ray revealed fluid overload with mild
increase in the cardiac silhouette and bilateral pleural
effusions. Patient received Lasix 10mg IV with good effect.
Levoflaxacin was d/c and vancomycin po was started. Patient was
hemodynamically stable and transferred to CC6 (floor).
.
HD5, patient was an episode of dropping oxygen saturation 84-88%
on 4Liters nasal cannula, lungs sounds positive for crackles at
the bases, patient received Lasix 20mg IV once with good effect.
WBC continued to trend down. She received substantial
electrolyte repletion of potassium, magnesium and neutrophos.
Patient started on a clear diabetic liquid diet and advanced to
regular diet. She was started on home dose of Lantus. Patient
continued to have multiple diarrhea stools. Central line was
d/c. Foley catheter was d/c and patient was voiding without
difficulty. Infectious disease, [**Hospital **] clinic and Physical
Therapy were consulted.
.
Infectious Disease was consulted on HD#5; patient presenting
with C. Diff infection in the absence of antibiotic use,
exposure or known contact at health care facility, and no recent
invasive procedures. Patient was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 976**] (Fellow)
and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 977**] (Attending), assessed that since patient
has a history of an autoimmune disorder, may not be completely
""normal"" host. The differential for pancolitis would also
include CMV colitis, ischemic colitis (less likely). They
recommended obtaining a CMV viral load, repeat iron studies
given microcytic anemia, plan to check C. Diff toxin prior to
starting vancomycin taper. continue with Vancomycin by mouth 250
mg every 6 hours times 14 days, then 250 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 7 days, then
250 mg daily x 7 days, then off. They also instructed patient on
hygiene techniques for her home.
.
Physical therapy consult concluded that patient may require
rehabiliation upon discharge if mobility does not improve.
Patient remains functioning below baseline level and
deconditioned from hospitalization. It was recommended that
patient would benefit from increase mobility and breathing
exercises.
.
[**Hospital **] Clinic was consulted on HD7 for management of IDDM.
Patient is known to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 978**] @ [**Hospital **] Clinic. They
recommended to increase Lantus to 12 units daily, increase
pre-meal sliding-scale, switch from regular insulin to humalog,
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 978**] after discharge.

OR, he was coagulopathic, requiring multiple blood products.
Hemodynamics improved and vasoactive drips were weaned by POD 1.
 The IABP was weaned and discontinued on POD 2. The patient was
aggressively diuresed and extubated on POD 3.  Beta blocker was
initiated and titrated as tolerated.  The patient was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest
tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  Norvasc and Lisinopril
were added for hypertension.  The patient has poor targets, and
Plavix was initiated.  By the time of discharge on POD 5 the
patient was ambulating with assistance, the wound was healing
and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was
discharged to [**Hospital 169**] Center of [**Location (un) 55**] in good
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.

Chief Complaint:
somnolence

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is an 87 year old lady with a PMH of diastolic heart
failure (EF>75%), severe lung disease and resultant pulmonary
hypertension, T2DM, obesity, who presents from home with hypoxia
and worsening somnolence.

Patient reports that since discharge from the hospital on
Saturday [**11-21**], she has had persistent increased sputum which
she has difficulty coughing up.  She feels like the sputum gets
caught in her throat.  It is white-clear.  She denies fever or
chills.  She denies worsening dyspnea, but has only ambulated in
her house as she hasn't been feeling well.  She endorses mild
orthopnea.  She denies worsening lower extremity edema.

Of note, patient was recently admitted for hypoxia with CXR
findings of a LUL.  She had presented to her cardiologist one
week prior to initial admission with complaints of worsening
dyspnea and increased sputum production, without fever or
leukocytosis.  At that time, cardiologist felt that patient was
having an acute flare of her chronic bronchitis, and placed her
on a one week course of levofloxacin.  A CXR was performed at
the time to rule out pneumonia which was negative for
consolidation.  She followed up with the cardiologist NP one
week later, and was found to have O2Sats ranging from 68-80% on
3L NC (baseline, home oxygen).  She continued to be afebrile
without leukocytosis but reported no improvement in sputum
production or dyspnea.  She was sent to the ER where a repeat
CXR showed bilateral upper lobe opacities concerning for
pneumonia.  She was given ceftriaxone and azithromycin and
admitted to the medicine service.  Antibiotics were not
continued as patient was afebrile, without cough or
leukocytosis.  Right lower extremity ultrasound was negative for
DVT.  Patient was discharged home as her oxygen saturations
returned to baseline on home 3L NC.

[**Name (NI) **] son reports that patient had BCG vaccination in
[**Country 532**].  He does not know if she was ever exposed to
tuberculosis.  He does not know of anyone in his family who was
exposed to tuberculosis.

In the ED inital vitals were 97.4 70 141/47 18 100%
Non-Rebreather.
ABG 7.35/91/105/46. She was given vanc/cefepime x1.  Lung exam
c/w decreased breath sounds, tachypneic to low 30s. She was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.

On arrival to the ICU, vital signs were 97.6, 69, 132/56, 18 and
96% on 3LNC.  Patient was comfortable and denied any pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
87 yo F with a history of diastolic heart failure, pulmonary
hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and chronic bronchitis
admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure. Hospital course
notable for acute renal failure.

#Hypoxia/Atypical Pneumonia/Pulmonary hypertension/Chronic
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease/Acute on chronic diastolic heart
failure/Hypercarbic respiratory failure/Obstructive Sleep Apnea:
Patient was initially admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with
hypercarbic respiratory which was felt to be due to over
oxygenation, and most likely worsening pulmonary hypertension
from volume overload and atypical pneumonia. She was diuresed
and treated with azithromycin with improvement in her symptoms.
She was also seen by the Pulmonary service for evaluation of her
pulmonary hypertension and episodes of apnea and they
recommended an outpatient sleep study. The patient did well and
was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the medical
floor and improved with antibiotics and further diuresis and was
discharged on home oxygen of 2-3L NC. Given that
over-ventilation and over-oxygenation was felt to contribute to
the patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure and somnolence,
the patient should have oxygen for a target oxygen saturation of
89-93%.

#Pulmonary nodules:
Patient had sputum production and a chest CT which showed 3 left
uppe lobe lung nodules that were most likely felt to be
infectious. She was ruled out for TB with 3 negative sputa for
AFB and patient received course of azithromycin. She should have
a follow up CXR in 6 weeks. Patient and son were made aware of
this and the importance of follow up.

#Acute on chronic diastolic Heart Failure:
As above patient was admitted in volume overload. Hospital
course was notable for improvement in symptoms with diuresis,
but complicated by acute renal failure (see below). Patient was
ultimately discharged euvolemic on regimen of Lasix 80mg once
daily to keep her euvolemic and TBB even.

#Acute on Chronic renal Failure:
During diuresis for acute heart failure, patient developed acute
renal failure with probable contraction alkalosis. At this point
diuresis was stopped, gentle fluids were given, and diuretics
were stared when renal function had returned to [**Location 213**].
Lisinopril was held and should be started 3 days after discharge
at 2.5mg po daily.

# Hypertension: Blood pressure was well controlled on home
regimen. Diltiazem was continued but Lisinopril was held during
acute renal failure.

# Diabetes mellitus:  HgbA1c 6.5 in 7/[**2138**].  On glipizide at
home. Patient was covered with sliding scale insulin in the
hospital. Glipizide can be restarted once renal function
stabilizes.

# Transitional issues:
AFB cultures will need to be followed-up
She will need close pulmonary follow-up for repeat imaging in
several weeks (fu of pulmonary nodules as well as follow up of
her likely COPD, severe pulmonary hypertension, and probable
sleep apnea
.
#Disposition: Patient was discharged to rehab.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mrs [**Known lastname **]:

It was a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital during your
stay; You were taken care of by a critical care team during your
ICU stay and a medicine primary team during your inpatient
hospitalization.  During your stay you received treatment for
congestive heart failure and continued treatment for a possible
pneumonia.  You will need to continue to restrict your salt
intake in order to prevent exacerbations of your heart failure.

Additionally, there was significant concern that you have
obstructive sleep apnea. You have appointments to see a sleep
medicine specialist and a pulmonologist.

The following changes were made to your medication regimen:
1) START guaifenesin  100 mg/5 mL Syrup  Sig:  Ten (10) ML PO
Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for sputum production/cough
2) START albuterol 0.083% neb solution, 1 nebulizer every 4
hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing
3) You may use saline nasal spray as needed for nasal dryness.
4) Your lasix dose was decreased to 80mg once daily (instead of
twice per day).
.
Please try to avoid ibuprofen and other NSAIDs orally if
possible because these could further damage your kidneys.
Please be sure to weigh yourself every morning and call your
primary care doctor if weight is increasing by more than 3 lbs.
You may need to have your lasix increased again.

Please be sure to keep all of your followup appointments as
listed below, including your followup with the cardiologist next
week.
.
No other changes were made to your medications and you should
continue to take all your other medications as originally
prescribed.

Lethargy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
82 year old male with past medical history of coronary artery
disease, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, BPH, chronic
kidney disease and gout who presents with intermittent confusion
and high fevers. The patient is [**First Name3 (LF) 595**] speaking only, generally
sleepy but family (son) recounts that the patient had difficulty
voiding 6/1-2/[**2150**]. At the time, he endorsed urinating
frequently but small amounts each time (?frequency, urgency)He
presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] and was found on urinalysis to have a
UTI. He did not have any fever/chills, nausea/vomiting, flank
pain at the time. He was discharged on Macrobid 100mg twice
daily X 7 days. The patient has been taking the medication
reliably but urine culture sensitivities/speciation today
demonstrated Enterobacter aerogenes sensitive to a number of
antibiotics, but resistant to macrobid. The patient's wife was
[**Name (NI) 653**] by the [**Name (NI) **] QA via [**Name (NI) 595**] interpreter and Cipro 250mg
tablets daily X 7 days was prescribed.
.
In the interim, the patient's son has been calling to check in
on him and found him progressively lethargic, dizzy and
intermittently unable to urinate. Today he slept throughout the
day and had some urinary frequency/urgency in the morning that
resolved this afternoon. He also developed high fevers
(temperature not taken) with rigors/shakes. He was noted to have
elevated blood sugars and lower blood pressures than normal. He
usually runs SBP160-180s, per his son, without antihypertensives
and SBP110-120s with them. This morning, he took all his
medications and subsequently, his blood pressures have been in
the SBP90s. The patient has taken in very little PO food/liquids
since [**2151-5-21**]. He did take one tablet of the Cipro this
afternoon and stated he felt somewhat better.
.
In the ED, initial VS: T100.8, HR96, BP111/46, RR20, O2 sat 97%
on RA. He was given acetaminophen 650mg PR and ciprofloacin
400mg IV X1. His labs were notable for hyponatremia (132), Cr
1.4 (close to prior baseline), leukocytosis to 11.9 with left
shift (no bands). His lactate was 1.6. He was also given IVF and
did become less lethargic, more interactive with family. He did
not urinate down in the ED to provide a repeat sample.
.
Upon transfer to the medical floor, vitals were T: 98.1 P: 88
BP: 103/45 RR: 25 SaO2: 95% on 2L NC (does not use oxygen at
home).

IMAGING:
[**2151-5-25**] NCHCT:  There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema,
mass effect, or large acute territorial infarction.  The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is well preserved. There is
mild age-related brain parenchymal atrophy with secondary mild
dilatation of the ventricles.

The paranasal sinuses and mastoids are clear.  There are no
suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.

IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial abnormality.

NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: There is significantly
disproportionate
lateral more than 3rd ventriculomegaly, compared to the degree
of sulcal
prominence; while this may simply represent preferential central
atrophy,
underlying communicating hydrocephalus is an additional
consideration, and
should be correlated clinically.
[**2151-5-25**] CXR:  There is a right infrahilar and a right lung apex
opacity, possibly representing multifocal PNA. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette and hila are normal.  There is no
pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.
[**2151-5-25**] EKG:  Atrial fibrillation. Left axis deviation. Right
bundle-branch block. Consider inferior myocardial infarction.
Since the previous tracing
of [**2145-5-31**], atrial fibrillation is new, axis is now more
leftward, and
QRS width is wider. Clinical correlation is suggested.
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T
90 0 172 410/462 0 -86 23
[**2151-5-26**] CXR:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient
has unchanged focal parenchymal opacities in the right upper and
right lower lobe.  In addition, however, there is an increase in
size of the cardiac silhouette, increase in diameter of the
pulmonary vessels and increase of the interstitial markings.
Altogether, these findings suggest interval appearance of
pulmonary edema.
[**2151-5-26**] EKG:   Atrial fibrillation with a modestly controlled
ventricular response. Left axis deviation. Right bundle-branch
block with left anterior fascicular block.  There are tiny R
waves in the inferior leads consistent with possible myocardial
infarction. Compared to tracing #1 atrial fibrillation has
replaced by atrial tachycardia.
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T
91 0 152 368/422 0 -77 56
[**2151-5-27**] CXR:  Right upper lobe consolidation is more conspicuous
than before.  Right perihilar and lower lobe opacities have
improved.  Cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are unchanged.
Right pleural effusion is stable.  There is improved pulmonary
edema. There are no new lung abnormalities.
[**2151-5-28**] ECHO:  The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %) secondary to
hypokinesis of the inferior, posterior, and lateral walls. The
right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free
wall function. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No vegetations seen
[**2151-5-29**] EKG:  Sinus rhythm. Prolonged P-R interval. Right
bundle-branch block with left anterior fascicular block.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2151-5-27**], the rhythm has
changed.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  89 yo w/ afib, LBBB and recurrent UTIs admitted with
urospesis requiring MICU transfer, discharged home with a 2 week
course of ciprofloxacin and home physical therapy.
.
ENTEROBACTER BACTERMIA AND SEPSIS:  Patient initially was seen
in the emergency department approximatley 1 week prior to
admission with a UTI, treated with macrobid.  The patient was
subsquently [**Telephone/Fax (3) 653**] by the Emergency Department after culture
results returned with a macrobid resistant enterobacter species
and perscribed ciprofloxacin.  Approximately 2 days after
starting ciprofloxacin, though it is unclear how many doses the
patient took, he developed lethargy, confusion and fevers at
home.  He was admitted to the medical service where he quickly
triggered for hypotension and was not responsive to 4 L of fluid
boluses.  He was broadened to Vanc/Cefepime and subsequently
developed pulmonary edema in the setting of volume reusitation
and was transfered to the MICU without requiring intubation.
Blood cultures returned GNRs in [**3-24**] bottles later speciated as a
pan-sensitive enterobacter similar to what was seen in the
urine.  CXR showed a possible multifocal pneumonia as well.
Infectious diseases was consulted and recommended treatment with
ciprofloxacin for a 2 week course despite the patient's
prolonged QTc from a prior intrafasicular block.  No inpatient
urologic evaluation was felt indciated though his recurrent
urinary tract infections and prior prostate operations did
warrant further outpatient evaluation.  QTc at discharge was 444
ms.
.
# TROPONINEMIA:  Patient was noted to have an elevated troponin
with a normal CK-MB fraction in the setting of septic shock and
volume resusitation.  Given his coronary history and underlying
LBBB perventing adequate evaluation of ischemic changes the
patient underwent ECHO which showed a posterior/inferior
hypokenesis.  Cardiololgy was consulted and felt this be related
to demand and not an acute coronary process.  Patient was
continued on home meds and scheduled for outpatient cardiology
follow up.
.
# HTN: Patient's antihypertensives were initially held in the
setting of sepsis.  His antihypertensives were gradually
restarted but the patient was symptomatically hypotensive on his
home regimen while working with phsyical therapy.  His
amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide were therefore held and
patient was able to maintain pressures in the 120s on valsartan
320 mg, lasix 40 and metoprolol XL 50 mg daily.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Stable continued on home statin.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: Stable, was intermittently in sinus
rhythm through out his stay.  Discharged on home metoprolol and
pradaxa.
.
# Diabetes mellitus, type 2: Stable, home oral hypoglycemics
were held in house in the setting of sepsis and patient
maintained on an insulin sliding scale.
.
# Benigm prostatic hypertrophy: s/p TURP and generally stable
though difficulty voiding and prior prostate instrumentation
raises the risk for recurrent UTIs.  Patient was scheduled for
outpatient urology follow up with his primary urologist Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 986**].
.
# Gout: Stable, no signs or symptoms of a flare continued home
allopurinol

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 59 year-old right-handed with progressively
worsening stiffness, weakness, and dysarthria since [**2183**] who is
sent in from her rehab for generalized weakness , decline and
difficulty eating. The patient is followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 951**] in the
movement disorders division who notes an extensive negative
workup in his most recent assessment of [**2186-1-10**] (see below).
Per
the record the stiffness started after a fall on ICE in [**2183**].
She
was admitted 7/21-26/07 for left leg dystonia. Possible
etiologies considered at that time included hereditary spastic
paraparesis, Parkinsons, and multiple systems atrophy. Little
evidence could be found for any of these disorders.


An new EMG today demonstrated a generalized, moderately severe,
chronic and ongoing disorder of motor neurons or their axons.


The patient has been on tizanidine, flexeril, baclofen, sinemet,
and artane - none with particularly significant effect.



Past Medical History:
depression,
rotator cuff injury,
osteopenia,
colectomy,
appendectomy
Per Dr.[**Name (NI) 1033**] [**2186-1-10**] note:
""Extensive prior evaluations were summarized in my note from [**6-11**], [**2185**], including multiple brain and spine imaging studies
that
have failed to yield an explanation for her symptoms. She also
was admitted. She has had negative HTLV 1 and 2 testing,
negatively glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies, negative
spinal fluid analyses including absence of oligoclonal bands,
normal ceruloplasmin, negative RPR, negative Lyme serology,
negative [**Doctor First Name **], rheumatoid factor, and HIV test. EMG also was
reported to be normal in 08/[**2185**]. She was admitted in [**2185-7-24**]

with increased mobility difficulties. The additional evaluation

did not reveal a clear etiology. They initiated a trial of
tizanidine, and this may have helped somewhat. They also reduced

her Flexeril dose.""


Social History:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1034**] currently is living at the [**Hospital 745**] Healthcare
Center nursing home.


Family History:
Notable for arthritis of the spine in her father
who also had limited use of one arm when he was older, but the
specifics again are difficult to clarify. She also has a son
with ""arthrogryposis"" who is in a wheelchair.


Physical Exam:
Vitals: T:98 P:96 R:18 BP:118/70 SaO2:95%RA
General: Awake, cooperative, NAD.

Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.



Neurologic:
-Mental Status: The patient regards the examiner and carries
papers with sheets of words that she points to in order to
communicate. She has another sheet with the alphabet on it that
she uses to spell out her words. She is able to communicate this
way however slowly. She indicated that she had heartburn. She
follows commands. Her responses to yes/no questions were correct
with vibration (versus not) of the tuning fork.



-Cranial Nerves: Olfaction not tested. PERRL 3 to 2mm and brisk.
VFF to confrontation. There is no ptosis bilaterally.
Funduscopic
exam was limited as the patient kept blinking and turning away.
EOMI without nystagmus. Normal saccades. Facial sensation intact
to pinprick. No facial droop, facial musculature symmetric.
Hearing intact to finger-rub bilaterally. Palate elevates
symmetrically. 5/5 strength in trapezii and SCM bilaterally.
Tongue protrudes only minimally and is very slow from side to
side.



-Motor: Right upper extremity more mobile than left. Right upper
extremity is spastic. Left upper extremity is hypertonic and
flexed. Bilaterally lower extremities are extended even at the
ankle. They are extremely hypertonic. She can move both lower
extremites, but only at the hips and then only minimally.



-Sensory: No deficits to light touch, pinprick, cold sensation,
vibratory sense, proprioception throughout.



-Coordination: FNF was slow but smooth and accurate with the

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1034**] is a 59-year-old woman who was admitted for
further evaluation of her chronic progressive movement disorder.
Based on her exam, which with her progression by the time of
this admission showed mixed upper and lower motor neuron signs,
and based on her EMG on the day of admission showing motor
neuron disease, she was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS).

1. ALS. She was set up to follow up in the [**Hospital **] clinic. After a
pulmonology consult, it was seen that she did well with her
respiratory status when sitting upright during the day, but has
paradoxical breathing at night. She was transferred for one

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Orthopedic service on [**2139-12-25**]
for a right subtrochanteric femur fracture after being evaluated
and treated with closed reduction in the emergency room. She was
noted to have a Hct=25.7, with a baseline of 30-32, so she was
given 2 units of packed red cells overnight. In addition, she
received one dose of kayexalate for hyperkalemia to 5.7 without
EKG changes. She underwent open reduction internal fixation of
the fracture without complication on [**2139-12-26**]. Please see
operative report for full details. She was extubated without
difficulty and transferred to the recovery room in stable
condition. In the early post-operative course Ms. [**Known lastname **]
developed anuria, with a creatinine bump above her baseline, and
she was transferred to the TSICU for further monitoring and
treatment of her volume status and worsening renal
insufficiency. During this time, she was transfused an
additional 2 units of packed red cells. She remained in the ICU
overnight and eventually showed improvement with good urine
output, and was transferred to the floor in stable condition.

On hospital day 3 she was transfused an additional 2 units of
packed red cells for post-operative anemia. On hospital day 5,
she received a visit from the Russian Cardiology Service who
recommended restarting her home Lasix, which was done.

She continued to make good urine had adequate pain management
and worked with physical therapy while in the hospital.  The
remainder of her hospital course was uneventful and Ms.
[**Known lastname **] is being discharged to rehab in stable condition. She
will follow with both her Cardiologist and Orthopedic trauma
team in 4 and 2 weeks, respectively.

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression: 45 yo man with h/o HIV (CD4=227) and multiple past
pneumonias presents with acute LUL pneumococcal pneumonia ans
sepsis.

PNEUMOCOCCAL PNEUMONIA AND SEPSIS
The patient presented with a cough productive of brown sputum,
pleuritic left sided chest pain, and a large left upper lobe
infiltrate on his CXR.  In the emergency department he became
tachypnic, hypoxic and hypotensive, with pressures that were not
responsive to fluid boluses.  He was intubated, started on
pressors and broad spectrum antibiotics, and admitted to the
MICU.  His admission blood cultures showed high grade bacteremia
with pneumococcus (3/4 bottles positive).  He underwent a
broncheoalveolar lavage, from which cultures have remained
negative.  Once the blood culture data returned his coverage was
initially narrowed to levaquin, but he had persistent low grade
fevers and a worsening of his leukocytosis, so was again started
on broader coverage with cefepime and vancomycin for a question
of ventillator associated pneumonia.  He was successfully
extubated on [**2143-3-15**] and was transferred to the floor the
following day.

On the floor his coverage was again narrowed, but again he
seemed to decompensate with low grade temps and worsening
leukocytosis, so cefepime and vancomycin were restarted.  Serial
CXRs done on [**3-15**] and [**3-18**] showed improvement in the LUL opacity
but development of a new LLL opacity and left sided pleural
effusion.  On [**3-20**], a chest CT was done which revealed a
significant left pleural effusion with LLL collapse.  The MET
service was called in for a thoracentesis. 600cc was removed
from the left lung, and sent for testing, which revealed an
exudative effusion without malignant cells.  Cultures were
negative.  An induced sputum was also done (as the patient was
not clearing his secretions) and grew sparce OP flora. Repeat CT
scan one week later showed marked resolution of LLL effusion. He
had evidence of progressing pneumonia, with new right sided tree
and [**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities. However clinically he appeared to be
improving, with decreased oxygen requirement and no further
fevers. Interventional pulmonary and pulmonary were consulted
for re-evaluation, but neither bronchosopy or re-tapping of left
sided pleural effusion were felt to be indicated. Given the
known suseptibility of his pneumococcus he was started again on
IV levofloxacin 500mg daily and cefepime and vancomycin were
discontinued. He remained afebrile on 3 days of IV therapy and
was therefore switched to PO regimen. His primary infectious
disease physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1057**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] to discuss his case.
It was felt that he should stay on Levofloxacin indefinitely
until a repeat CT scan may be performed as an outpatient to
document clearance of his infection. At that point he may need
chronic suppressive therapy, possibly with penicillin. He will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1057**] on [**4-17**] and with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 1058**]
on [**5-3**].

CHEST PAIN
On admission the patient complained of pleuritic left-sided
chest pain.  EKG did not show changes consistent with ACS, and
one set of cardiac enzymes was negative.  Once extubated and
transferred to the floor, he comtinued to have significant
discomfort.  His pain was pleuritic but was also worse with
palpation.  An EKG showed isolated TWI in V2 and another set of
cardiac enzymes was flat.  CXR at that time showed only
improving LUL opacity.  The pain was attributed to left-sided
pleural inflammation secondary to his known infection.  He was
started on narcotic pain medications, which somewhat controlled
the pain.  The pain service was also consulted to help the
primary team manage the complicated pain issues in this patient.
They suggested adding methadone and a lidoderm patch, with
ibuprofen if tolerated, with plan to taper off of oxycontin. The
main concern over opiate analgesics was his prior history of
substance abuse. However after discussion with the team, it was
felt that he had a legitimate reason for pleuritic pain, so he
was kept on both oxycontin and methadone for optimal pain
control, in addition to lidoderm patch. This regimen led to very
good pain control, with patient reporting 0/10 pain. Therefore
the plan is to taper off methadone slowly as pain continues to
resolve concurrently with his pneumonia. At the time of
discharge he is on 20mg oxycodone SR [**Hospital1 **] and 7.5 mg Methadone
TID. We will taper him down to 5mg [**Hospital1 **] Methadone, and this may
be tapered off over the next 1-2 weeks as his symptoms continue
to improve. He may be maintained on the oxycodone as needed for
long-term pain control. At the time of discharge he was also
re-started on Neurontin for his chronic neuropathic leg pain.

HYPOTENSION
As above, the patient became hypotensive in the ED.  This was
thought to be likely [**1-9**] septic shock, and he was quickly weaned
off pressors.  He underwent a cortisol stimulation test, which
showed an AM cortisol of 17, but the level did not respond to
cosyntropin.  Therefore, he was given a 7 day of hydrocortisone
and fludrocortisone for suspected adrenal insufficiency.  Blood
pressures improved and remained stable. He did have a subsequent
transient episode of low blood pressures to 80's systolic, felt
likely to increased pain medications and volume depletion to
poor PO intake. He responded well to NS IVF boluses, and
remained HD stable the remainder of his course. Subsequent
re-check of am cortisol showed a normal level.

ANEMIA
The patient is s/p an extensive prior workup.  During this
hospitalization he was guiac negative.  His HCT was generally in
the low to mid 20s, and he was given a unit of PRBCs with an
appropriate HCT bump.  A reticulocyte count revealed appropriate
marrow production.  Iron studies were repeated during this
admission and were consistent with an anemia of chronic disease,
possibly secondary to his HIV.

HIV
The patient is followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1059**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1057**] for his HIV.  He has
been off HAART medications given significant depression and
suicidality at times.  He continues to be on dapsone prophylaxis
for PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] most recent CD4 count was 227 and viral load was
52,000 in [**11-10**].

HCV
Similarly, treatment of his HCV has been deferred.  His most
recent viral load was in [**2140**] was 4,480,000.

Depression
The patient is not currently on treatment for his depression and
did not express any suicidal ideation during this inpatient
stay.  He was seen by [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 1060**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1061**] while here, with plan to
follow-up in clinic after his rehab stay to readdress any social
needs or possible drug rehabilation program if needed.

Cystic lesion of pancreas
Incidentally found on chest CT and should be f/u with MR [**First Name (Titles) 3**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1062**]t.

PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1065**], viral, atypical PNA.  As pt has h/o
hospitalizations MRSA also possible.  Initially started on
Vancomycin, IV ceftriaxone, azithromycin.  Blooc Cx, sputum
cultures, ua and urine cultures.  He was given supplemental O2.
Plan was for bronchosopy.  While he was at [**Last Name (un) 1066**] he had an
episode where he was noted to be progressively more short of
breath and tachypneic, RR 20.  SpO2 80% on NRB.  pt did not get
bronch and was transferred to MICu for possible intubation.
ABGs on NRB mask 7.46/31/366.  In the MICU he was sating well
after transfer to ICU.  He was weaned of NRB and to 4L NC
quickly.  In discussion with ID, the Zosyn was discontinued, and
he was kept on CTX, vancomycin,a d azithromycin for a probable
CAP. PCp ws felt to be less likely based on improving
oxygenation and radiographic evidence, and so PCP regimen was
[**Name9 (PRE) 1067**].  MS contin and morphine for pain control.  Crypto ag
was negative, CMV vl, [**Name9 (PRE) **] and AFB were sent.  He got a
induced sputum AM of [**2144-2-7**].  There after patient stated that he
wanted to leave the hospital.  Multiple attempts to counsel
patient regarding the risks of leaving by several team memebers
were unsuccessful.  He was given Azithro for 7 days and
Cefpodoxime for 2 weeks for PNA.  He was advised on the results
of induced sputum with PCP and to finish the antibiotics.

Brief Hospital Course:

1) Respiratory distress: Improved with face mask. Serial ABGs
showed hypercarbic failure, improved with face mask. Switched to
nasal cannula in PM [**11-18**], but ABGs with ongoing hypercarbia in
the 80s. At night, patient had sub-acute worsening respiratory
status, with desaturation and tachypnea, along with agitation
and confusion. pH with PCO2 in 90s. Placed on CPAP,
unsuccessfully. Repeat ABG with PaCO2 87, pH 7.29. Patient
intubated. Arterial line finally placed successfully. Extubated
on [**11-19**] but extremely anxious and hypertensive and hypercarbic.
Placed on BIPAP and reintubated. [**2178-11-23**] trach placed.  Pt was
stable with the trach and venitilator support.  Pt has been
maintaining stable oxygenation and ventilation on pressure
controlled ventilation with PS 3, PEEP 5, Fi02 0.5, PIP 22, TV
500-600, RR18.
He benefited from albuterol/atrovent nebs, suction, steroids. At
the time of discharge he was on day 4 of prednisone taper.  Pt
was also on Zosyn for GNR, has h/o pseudomonas. No further abx
at the time of discharge.

2) [**Name (NI) 283**] Pt was placed on amiodarone for afib, but this was
discontinued when he developed persistent bradycardia to the
30's-40's on [**2177-11-29**]. Pt was also anticoagulated on a heparin
drip and on [**11-24**] began coumadin loading.

3)bradycardia- likely [**12-30**] amiodarone; resolved after holding
this med ([**2178-11-30**]). pt will follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 284**] and will
likely need a Holter Monitor as an outpt. TFT's pending at time
of discharge.

4) agitation: likely due to hypercarbic reso drive, controlled
with haldol and then resolved completely when respiratory status
stabilized.

5) DM: controlled on RISS with standing dose of NPH.

6) FEN: [**Last Name (STitle) 282**] tube placed on [**2177-11-29**] without complication.

Brief Hospital Course:
64 year-old male with history of lung cancer post-right
pneumonectomy, severe COPD, recent trach and [**Year/Month/Day 282**] placement and
antibiotic course for pneumonia, now returns from [**Hospital **] rehab
with diarrhea, stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer, and sepsis. No
source of infection had been identified so far. He was C-diff
negative, blood/urine/sputum culture had not yield any organism.
He was treated empirically with ceftazidime, vancomycin and
metronidazole for 7 days. His blood pressure responded to fluid
challenge and he has been normotensive since then. He was
started on stress dose steroid which was weaned off. He was
gradually weaned off ventilation and tolerated trach mask well.

His blood sugar was well controlled with glargine and sliding
scale. He was also noted to have decubitus ulcer. Plastic
surgery was consulted and felt that debridement was not
necessary. Therefore, he was cotinued on wet to dry dressing,
Kinair bed and his nutrition was optimized. He remiained in
normal sinus rhythm and is on coumadin for history of atrial
fibrillation.

He was very agitated in the ICU. He was weaned off fentanyl drip
and put on fentanyl patch. He also was put on standing zyprexa
and prn haldol, morphine. He was also on standing valium and was
actually thought to be in benzo withdrawal as his wife claims
that he was on valium at home.He is full code and his health

studies:
CT abd/pelvis [**2145-12-9**]: 1. Nodular opacities within a
bronchovascular distribution most notable in the left lung base
and less so on the right most consistent with aspiration
pneumonia given clinical history. However given
immunocompromised status atypical infections including
tuberculosis must be considered and respirtory precautions
advised.  2. Cystic pancreatic tail lesion also noted on study
from [**2141**] without detectable change.  3. Generalized cachexia,
likely AIDS-wasting syndrome
.
CT C-spine [**2145-12-9**]: 1. Right supraclavicular fossa hematoma
corresponding with recent central venous line attempt in this
location.  2. No evidence of acute fracture or dislocation.  3.
Partially imaged right apical opacity and right apical
subpleural blebs.
.
CT head [**2145-12-9**]: 1. No acute hemmorage or mass effect.  2. Mild
cerebral atrophy which is not age appropriate consistent with
HIV encephalopathy.  3. Confluent regions of hypoattenuation in
the deep white matter which is unchanged from [**Month (only) 1096**] yet new
since [**2141**]. While this may represent sequlae of HIV
encephalopathy, an underlying infectious etiology such as PML
may be considered and an MRI may be helpful.
.
CXR [**2145-12-9**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Slightly low lying ET tube, approximately 3 cm above the
carina. This could be withdrawn slightly.
2. Small, patchy opacities at the left lung base which appear to
correspond to tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities seen on previous chest CT
.
MRI head [**2145-12-10**]: 1. No evidence of bacterial or fungal
infection. However, extensive white matter hyperintensity is
often found in patients with HIV encephalopathy.  2. Several
foci of apparent infarction or encephalitis in the corpus
callosum raise the possibility of meningitis.
.
Echo [**2145-12-13**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). A 24mmHg peak mid-cavitary
gradient is identified. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-2-6**],
left ventricular systolic function is now dynamic with a higher
heart rate and mild resting mid-cavitary gradient.
Is there a history to suggest a high output state (e.g.,
thiamine deficiency, hyperthyroidism, anemia, fever, etc.?

Brief Hospital Course:
48 y.o. M with h/o HIV/AIDs, h/o TB, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] infections,
noncompliant with his medications, recent history of
falls/traumas found down for possibly three days, minimally
responsive, intubated for airway protection.  The course also
complicated by R neck hematoma due to line placement, alkalosis,
hypernatremia, hypercalcemia, improved ARF, elevated lactate,
transaminitis.

# AMS - multifactorial.  Was found down and c-collar placed.
Came with elevated CKs consistent with Rhabdomyalysis, improved
with IVFs.  Concern for toxic metabilic encephalopathy
(infection, hypernatremia, hypercalcemia) as well as HIV
encephalopathy.  He was intubated for airway protection.  He was
treated with broad ABX as detailed below.  Metabolic
abnormalities improved with IVFs, and he had a negative LP for
infection, but.  MRI was also negative for stroke or mass
lession.  His mental status improved and he was extubated, but
he is not at baseline (he walked out of [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2145-12-1**] after
signing out against medical advise).   CT c-spine was negative
for fracture, but his C-collar was not cleared due to ongoing
altered mental status.  He currently follows some commands but
remains globally weak and will require a neurology consult to
address this and his mental status.  He was given limited
narcotics for pain of undetermined source (seemed in pain with
even light touch to skin).  Would recommend not using too much
narcotics for pain as it will likely cloud mental status.

# ID - AIDs pt not on HAART.   Infectious disease team was
consulted and followed throughout his hospitalization.
Initially, he was covered broadly initially with
vanco/cefepime/flagyl.  He was also on Acycovir to cover for HSV
encephalitis, but this was stopped when CSF was negative for
HSV.  The pt underwent LP and Bronchoscopy.  He had blood,
urine, sputum, stool, and CSF sent for culture.  Stool was
positive for Cdiff on [**2145-12-10**].  He needs to continue on flagyl
for 14 days after all other ABX completed.  Sputum was positive
for MRSA on [**2145-12-10**], and he needs a 14 day course of vancomycin
(currenly, today [**12-16**] is day #8).  He also had pseudomonas
(sparse growth) in sputum and GNRs not otherwise speciated in
his sputum [**2145-12-12**], and Cefepime changed to Zosyn and then to
Meropenem for gram negative coverage.  Meropenem course is 15
days (currently, today [**2145-12-16**] is day #5).  Of note, 1 colony of
Aspergillus was grown on [**2145-12-12**] from sputum and a CT chest was
done on [**2145-12-16**] which did not reveal evidence of invasive
aspergillus.  Galactomannan was sent and needs to be followed
up.  ID recommended NOT to start treatment for aspergillus.  Pt
needs to follow up with ID, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1059**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1057**], within 2-3 weeks.
Appointment needs to be scheduled.

# Hypernatremia - Felt due to poor free water intake intake and
dehydration while on ground at home.  He was given IVFs and free
H20 and his sodium returned to [**Location 213**] (139 at time of
discharge).

# C-collar - CT c-spine negative, but could not clear collar due
to altered mental status.  Pt needs to have this cleared at
rehab

# Rhabdomylosis - likely due to being down, CK peaked at 3996,
and improved to normal with IVFs.  Renal failure resolved.

# ARF - likely prerenal with component of rhabdomylosis.  Cr 1.6
upon admission, improved to 0.6 by the time of discharge.

# transaminitis - Known Hep C.  Levels were monitored and
trended down to normal by the time of d/c.

# R neck hematoma - stable clinically.  Serial Hcts were checked
and remained stable.

# PPx - H2 [**Hospital1 **], Heparin SQ, senna/colace

# FEN: He was initiated on tube feeds.  He needs a speech and
swallow evaluation to see if he can protect his airway with PO
intake.  Hypernatremia and hypercalcemia resolved with IVFs

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 48M w/ HIV/AIDS/HCV/IVDA sent from [**Hospital1 1099**] Rehab for evaluation of 2 witnessed tonic-clonic
seizures.  Seizures occurred on evening [**2146-1-13**], lasted 30
seconds - 1 minute,  resolved spontaneously.  First seizure
occured while he was being cleaned up, second seizure occured
while family member (mother?) was in the room. His nurse
reported 'whole body shaking' L>R, not responsive to name or
sternal rub, dilated pupils, no LOC. Patient w/ foley, so not
able to assess loss of bladder function, no bowel movement
yesterday.  Patient appeared 'sleepy' afterwards but then seemed
to return to his normal self between seizures.  Hypertensive -
received nitropaste.  Afebrile, T max 99.8, BP 116-120's/86-106,
HR 78-129, O2 sat96% on 2L.  Also found to be hypokalemic with K
2.6, started on IVF @10cc/hrKcl 40 mEq [**Hospital1 **] x 6 doses.
.
No nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, no fevers/chills, no seizure
history.
Per brother, patient has had HIV encephalopathy x 1 month, not
completely oriented at baseline. His nurse describes his
baseline as oriented to self only, Spanish speaking with some
English, has sensation of pain to minimal stimulus.
.
ED Course:  arrived [**1-13**] @9pm. Never oriented, drowsy --> very
agitated.  VS 98.5, HR 97, PB 134/89, RR 16, 02 sat 100% on 2L.
Negative head CT.  Midnight - noted to have tonic clonic seizure
activity lasting 1-2 minutes, post-ictal.  O2 sat 100% on non
rebreather, weaned easily.  Given Ceftriaxone 2gm, Vanc 1gm,
Ampicillin 2gm, Acyclovir 700mg. Sedated for LP (2mg Versed and
2mg Ativan).  200mg IV Diflucan for thrush.  Morphine for pain,
received total of 12mg.  Also received 2 gm IV magnesium, NS w/
40 mEq of K x 2L. Hypertensive in 140-150s and tachy up to 130's
throughout ED stay, Tmax 100.9 (not during seizure).
.
After arrival to the ICU, it was discovered that he had a urine
culture positive for acinetobacter at rehab and was started on
imipenem. BCx had reportedly been negative after 5 days.
.
Previous hospitalization ([**Date range (1) 1100**]) for change in MS after
being found down and minimally responsive; he was intubated for
airway protection; course complicated by R neck hematoma [**1-8**] to
line placement, alkalosis, hypernatremia, hypercacemia, improved
ARF, elevated lactate, transaminitis.  Concern for toxic
metabolic encephalopathy, improved somewhat with fluids but did
not return to baseline. Also with rhabdomylosis - CK peaked at
3996, and improved to normal with IVFs, renal failure also
resolved.  He was positive for c-diff, had MRSA positive sputum,
and sparse pseudomonas growth in sputum. When discharged he
needed 6 more days to finish 14 day course of vancomycin, 10
more days to complete 15 day course of meropenem and needed to
continue on flagyl for 14 days after all other ABX completed.

At discharge, vitals were stable.  The patient was afebrile.
The patient was more oriented.  He was able to communicate his
needs in English.  His neck was rotated the left and he had some
muscular spasm.  His abdomen was benign.  The remained of his
exam was unchanged.

Pertinent Results:
CXR ([**2146-1-23**]): Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. NG tube
tip is in the stomach. There is no pneumothorax or pleural
effusion. The lungs are grossly clear. Surgical clips projecting
over the left supraclavicular area are again noted. Left PICC
remains in place.

EKG: Sinus tachycardia, rate 115 beats per minute. Right atrial
abnormality. Possible old septal myocardial infarction. Possible
left ventricular hypertrophy. Tracing is compatible with
pulmonary disease. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2145-12-9**] QS
complexes in leads V1-V2 are less prominent and there is less
suggestion of possible left ventricular hypertrophy. Both
tracings are compatible with pulmonary disease.

CT Head ([**2146-1-13**]):
FINDINGS: Multiple acquisitions were performed due to patient
compliance. Despite this, there is motion artifact on the study
acquired limiting the evaluation.

There again noted is extensive confluent low attenuation
throughout the deep white matter of the brain. This is likely
related to underlying HIV encephalopathy. There is a advance
atrophy for age which is consistently seen in HIV encephalopathy
as well. There is no acute interval change or midline shift. No
intracranial hemorrhage is evident.

IMPRESSION: Stable head CT examination, although the current
examination is limited as above. Findings most consistent with
HIV encephalopathy with no superimposed acute process.

CT Neck: FINDINGS:

The patient is rotated to the left side, with the neck being
rotated to the left side. Hence, this study is limited in
acquiring the images in a proper manner, centered onto the
midline of the neck. In addition, lack of IV contrast,
significantly limits evaluation for any focal infection.

Within these limitations, there are no large masses noted on the
visualized images of the neck.

However, subtle areas of increased attenuation in the fat and
inflammation cannot be assessed.

There is moderate dilatation of the esophagus with small amount
of fluid/debris within the esophagus. This finding is new
compared to the CT chest on [**2145-12-16**], with interval removal of
the nasogastric tube.
Right-sided PICC line is incompletely included on the present
study.

There are a few surgical clips, noted lateral to the left side
of the thyroid, unchanged in position, compared to the prior CT
chest on [**2145-12-16**].

There is moderate dilatation of the ventricles on the visualized
images of the brain, which was noted on the prior MRI of the
head; however, the brain is incompletely included on the present
study.

There is a small 4-mm soft tissue density nodule in the upper
lobe of the left lung, unchanged.

There appears to be resolution of the previously noted
pneumothorax in the apices. However, the chest is not completely
evaluated on the present study.

There is moderate dilatation of the ventricles on the visualized
images of the brain, which was noted on the prior MRI of the
head; however, the brain is incompletely included on the present
study.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Seizures:  The patient had two witnessed tonic-clonic seizures
before presenting to [**Hospital1 18**] ED and one seizure in the ED.  The
most likely etiology for patient's seizures is imipenem which
was used to treat his urine culture positive for acinetobacter
and elavil which was given at high doses for neuropathy. Mr.
[**Known lastname 1071**] is thought to have HIV encephalopathy and this condition
combined with imipenem may have lowered his seizure threshold.
Patient's amitriptyline was also considered as possible cause of
patient's seizures.

Infectious etiology or mass effect were ruled out by [**Hospital 228**]
hospital course, benign appearance of CSF, and head CT;
however, initially the patient was given empiric IV acyclovir,
ceftriaxone, and vancomycin because of suspicion of viral or
bacterial central nervous system infection. Of note, patient has
had no seizures since admission and stopping of imipenem and
amitriptyline. The patient was started on 500 mg levetiracetam
(Keppra) [**Hospital1 **] as anti-seizure medication.  Per the neurology
service, the patient should be on Keppra indefinitely.

# Mental status changes:  The patient's mental status changes
are likely due to HIV encephalopathy.   CT showed no CNS mass
effect and no acute CNS infectious etiology found.  Patient's
mental status changes date back to [**11-13**] admission when patient
left hospital AMA, never having gone back to baseline mental
status s/p presumed fall.   Patient's CMV viral loads were low
(2160) and treatment was deferred since there was no sign
end-organ disease.  The patient was examined by Ophthomaology
who did not see any signs of CMV retinitis.

# Urine:  The patient was found to have acinetobacter in his
urine sensitive to gentamicin.  He was started on a three day
course of IV gentamicin on [**1-26**].  He will need his final dose
today at rehab ([**2146-1-28**]).  Please recheck a UA and culture
tomorrow ([**2146-1-29**]) to confirm his urine has cleared
appropriately.  The patient has also had urinary retention
during this hospitalization.  He failed two voiding trials
during this stay.  As he improves, he can be given another
voiding trial or can follow up with Urology if needed.

# Neck position:  The patient had head turned to left and was
resistant to changing position and has point tenderness
bilaterally on sides of neck.  Neck CT without contrast obtained
(could not use contrast as could not obtain peripheral IV access
necessary) but study was inconclusive due to patient positioning
and lack of contrast.  Patient continuesd to keep head turned to
left with some improvement noted with use of clonazepam.  Please
continue low dose clonazepam to help with muscular spasm.  If
the patient continues to have neck pain, consider re-imaging the
neck.

# Allodynia:  The patient had complaints of allodynia on last
admission and reports of neuropathic pain dating back to [**2142**].
This allodynia may be part of the spectrum of his neuropathy
which is thought to be secondary to HIV.  According to OMR, the
patient has not had relief of his neuropathy with gabapentin in
the past.  However, after patient left ICU for floor, opiates
were held because of worries of sedation affecting mental
status.  His pain was treated with gabapentin and acetaminophen.
 We did not restart his opiates during this hospitalization nor
his Remeron.

# Hypokalemia/hypomagnesmia:  On admission, the patient was
hypokalemic (K of 3.0) and hypomagnesemic (1.1).  Patient's poor
nutrition (albumin of 2.6) and no PO intake most likely cause.
As feeding via NG tube began, lytes were monitored [**Hospital1 **] in order
to assess refeeding syndrome.  At the time of discharge, the
patient's PO intake was improving.  He was able to eat his
entire breakfast with help from the nursing staff.  Please
continue to monitor his electrolytes while he is on TPN at least
daily replete his electrolytes as needed and change TPN based on
electrolytes.  Once he is able to increase his PO intake, please
consider discontinuing the TPN.  Once discontinued, the patient
will not need his electrolytes monitored daily.  Please
discontinue his PICC line once he no longer needs TPN.

# HIV:  The patient is not on HAART (as he has declined it).  ID
did not recommend HAART as HAART carries increased risk of
toxicity in setting of poor nutrition, and patient is vulnerable
to immune reconstitution syndrome with low CD4 count at start of
HAART and patient has known Hepatitis C.  ID's recommendation
was that HAART not be initiated until Mr. [**Known lastname 1101**] nutritional
status improves and that Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1057**] (outpatient ID doctor for
patient) should make decisions about implementing HAART.
Patient has follow up appointment on [**3-2**] at 9:30 AM with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1057**].  Please continue his Dapsone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].

# Fluid, electrolytes, nutrion:  Patient was profoundly
cachectic, had not eaten in several days and failed a speech and
swallow evaluation.  GI did not wish to place PEG because of
patient's low albumin (which would impede healing) and prominent
epigastric surgical scar.  Patient received NG tube on [**2146-1-21**]
after neck was imaged with CT.  NG tube feeds began at midnight
on night of [**2146-1-21**] at 10 ml/hr.  Rate was increased by 10 ml/hr
every 12 hours with a goal rate of 50 ml/hour acheived at
midnight on Sunday [**2146-1-23**].  However, tube came out and patient
refused replacement.  Patient did ask for tube to be replaced on
[**1-25**] but after primary medical team could not place tube,
patient refused IR placement of NG tube.  Patient was begun on
TPN on [**2146-1-27**].  Patient's lytes were repleted PRN as mentioned
above.  The patient is having improved PO intake and TPN can be
discontinued when patient is taking adequate oral intake.  If
needed, the patient can be re-evaulated by Speech and swallow in
the future.

Despite numerous discussions with the family regarding poor
prognosis, the patient remained full code throughout his
hospital course.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 64 yo man s/p lung ca s/p pneumonectomy and severe COPD
here after prolonged admission for respiratory failure requiring
tracheostomy placement here with new left sided chest pain.
.
1. Chest pain: Multiple sets of cardiac enzymes were cycled and
CK/MB remained flat while troponin increased slightly and then
remained stable at 0.12.  Repeat EKGs showed no changes.
Cardiology was consulted and agreed that there was no evidence
of an acute ischemic event.  Pt was continued on ASA.  The pt's
chest pain may be related to his chronic SVC syndrome.
.
2. Respiratory Failure: Pt on a prolonged ventilator wean
secondary to COPD, pneumonectomy, lung cancer and hx of
recurrent pneumonias.  Pt was continued on AC at night and
pressure support during the day.  He will continued to wean at
rehab.
.
3. Bilateral upper extremety swelling: This has been chronic
since last admission w/o evidence of DVT.  Pt had another CTA in
the ER that showed no PE but did show a narrowing of the SVC.
Interventional radiology placed a stent in the SVC and over the
next several days, the pt's upper ext swelling improved.
.
4. Atrial fibrillation: Pt remained in normal sinus rhythm for
most of the hospital stay except for a brief episode of a fib
with rapid ventricular rate which resolved on its own.  Pt was
continued on his coumadin.
.
5. Anxiety: Pt has a long history of anxiety controlled on
fentanyl, morphine prn, haldol. AVOID benzos as pt has
paradoxical response.
*
6. Anemia: Likely secondary to chronic disease- baseline around
28.  Iron studies were sent and revealed a low iron with normal
TIBC, ferritin.  He was transfused once to [**Last Name (un) 291**] hct>30.
.
7. DM type 2: Pt's glucose was controlled with glargine and an
insulin sliding scale.
.
8. Access: A PICC line was placed by IR when pt was having his
SVC stented.  If this line is not needed, it should be pulled to
decrease infection risk.  It was placed on [**2179-2-4**].

Social History:
Lives at home alone, independent.  Quite smoking 8 years ago but
50 pack year smoking hx.

Family History:
Non-contributory

Physical Exam:
98.2, 68, 100/48, RR15, 98% on RA
Gen:  Cachectic appearing elderly male, resting comfortably in
bed, appearing in pain with movement.
Neck: No JVD.
Cor: RR, normal rate, no m/r/g.
Lungs: CTA b/l.
Abd: NABS, soft, NT/ND
Extr: No c/c/e.  R BKA.  Swollen, erythematous R knee,
exquisitely tender.  Trace PT on the L.

Pertinent Results:
[**3-28**] AP, LATERAL AND SUNRISE VIEWS OF THE PATELLA: No prior
studies are available for comparison. There is a horizontal
fracture through the patella with 1.2 cm of displacement of the
fragments anteriorly. There is a small joint effusion. There are
changes from prior BKA, and extensive [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] calcifications
are present.
IMPRESSION: Horizontal patellar fracture with 1.2 cm of
displacement anteriorly.

[**3-28**] PELVIS AND RIGHT HIP, THREE VIEWS: There is a transverse
lucency through the femoral neck, which may represent a
nondisplaced fracture. No other fractures or dislocations are
identified. Degenerative changes of the SI and hip joints are
noted. There is diffuse demineralization. Extensive [**Month/Year (2) 1106**]
calcifications and iliac stents are noted.
IMPRESSION: Transverse lucency through the femoral neck, which
may represent a nondisplaced fracture.

[**3-28**] CT PELVIS:  There is a nondisplaced fracture of the
proximal right femoral neck. No other fractures or dislocations
are identified. There is diffuse osteopenia. There is a small
amount of high attenuation fluid within the right hip joint
space, which may represent a small amount of hemorrhage.
Extensive [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] calcifications are seen as are bilateral
iliac stents. Visualized portions of the pelvis are
unremarkable. Soft tissue structures are within normal limits.
IMPRESSION: Nondisplaced fracture of the right femoral neck.


Brief Hospital Course:
78 year old male with extensive medical history, notably
including CAD s/p CABG in [**2117**], MI [**2123**], MIBI with fixed and
reversible defects in [**2129**], CHF with EF 20%, PVD s/p R BKA with
b/l iliac stents, AAA found to be 5.4 x 5.0 cm on recent
abdominal US, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, who uses a RLE
prosthesis for ambulation s/p R BKA, who presents s/p mechanical
fall with R patellar and R femoral neck fractures, here for
orthopedic surgery.

1) Ortho:  Patient is high risk for surgery, however per ortho,
surgery will not be extensive, could be completed in relatively
short time frame, possibly under spinal anesthesia only.
Awaiting cardiolgy consult for estimate of operative risk given
recent MIBI with reversible defects in all territories, and cath
with 3VD.  Patient willing to accept 25-30% chance of operative
mortality.  [**Year (4 digits) **] has seen patient and says o.k. for surgery.
 Limiting factor may be INR, as still 2.9 with 5 mg Vitamin K.
Another 5 mg given, but may need FFP/platelets, and given EF
30%, would likely need to be done under controlled setting in
ICU in case of respiratory distress.  [**Month (only) 116**] defer until tomorrow.
Needs patellar surgery one way or another in order to ever be
able to use prosthesis again.

2) AAA:  Seen by [**Month (only) 1106**].  Will try to get CTA during
hospitalization at some point, though not now in setting of
worsened creatinine.  [**Month (only) 116**] just be able to get abdominal US.
Appreciate [**Month (only) 1106**] consult.  Outpatient repair of AAA.

3) CHF:  Class [**Last Name (LF) 1105**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 20% in past, though 30% on most recent
cath, currently dry on exam, therefore holding lasix.  If
patient doesn't go to surgery tonight, will order food and will
likely order lasix then.  Also will need lasix with any
FFP/platelets.
-Coumadin for goal INR [**1-10**]

4) PVD:  Bilateral iliac stents, on coumadin, therefore once INR
below 2, will have to start heparin drip.
--recheck INR post second dose of vitamin K, if < 2.0, will
start heparin, and d/c prior to surgery

5) A-fib: As above, holding coumadin.

6) CRI:  Slightly above baseline.  Holding ACE-I.

7) FEN:  K borerline therefore holding ACE-I.  No fluids.  Will
order food if pt. doesn't go to OR.

8) Code: Full.

9) PPx: Heparin drip then transfer to coumadin, senna, colace.

Removed RIJ CVL and placed peripheral IV on [**2132-4-9**]. Hct 29.7 on
discharge. Needs daily Hct and INR. Transfuse Hct<28 and keep

Brief Hospital Course:
65yo man with many medical problems p/w hypotension in the
setting of rapid aitral flutter. Also with a Urinary Tract
Infection.

Assessment/Plan: 64 year-old male w/ history of lung ca s/p
right pneumonectomy, severe COPD, recent trach and [**Month/Day/Year 282**] [**Hospital **]
rehab with a flutter 2:1, leukocytosis, hypotension and UTI.
.
1. Hypotension:  [**Month (only) 116**] have been due to infection from UTI vs.
symptomatic tachycardia.
Responded to aggresive fluid resusciation and rate control.
Remained normotensive for the rest of hospitalization. Of note,
his blood pressures were lower in left arm and family reported
that this is a [**Last Name 294**] problem for him.
.
2. Atrial Flutter: He has a known history of paroxysmal Atrial
Fibrillation.His was initially in rapid Atrial Fluuter with 2:1
conduction. This initially responded to diltiazem. On hopital
day #2 he went back into artial flutter and in consultation with
Electrophysiology service Amiodarone was initiated and diltiazem
was stopped (as he had been on Amiodarone for 3.5 years in the
past, and it had to be discontinued [**10-31**] due to bradycardia
when lopressor was added).  He remained in sinus rhythm for the
remainder of the hospitalization. Plan is continue Amiodarone
400mg TID x 1 week then 400mg [**Hospital1 **] x 1 week then 200mg po QD
thereafter.  He is to avoid beta blockers and calcium channel
blockers.

3. Respiratory Failure:  His chest x-ray showed no evidence of
Pneumonia. Due to a notable trach leak, his trach was changed by
respiraotory. An interventional Pulmonolgy consult was obtained
due to concern of cuff leak and possible tracheomalacia.  Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] recommended keeping the cuff pressures low with a cuff
leak to prevent further tracheamalacia-- he would be willing to
change the trach to a foam-filled trach ([**Last Name (un) 295**] tube) in the
future if the cuff leak is interfering with the ability to
ventilate.  He was continued on PS as tolerated with periods of
rest on Assist Control.
.
4. Klebsiella Urinary Tract Infection: He was initally started
on ceftriaxone which was changed to levofloxacin but given
history of heart block to levo, he was changed to Bactrim to
complete a 7-day course for complicated UTI. The Urine Culture
grew Klebsiella which is sensitive to Bactrim.His foley catheter
was discontinued.
.
5.Acute Blood Loss Anemia: His baseline hematocrit was 28-30. He
was initially hemo-concentrated, but then on hospital day #3,
his hematorcit dropped to 19.  due to extensive bleeding from
site of central line, he was transfused 2 UPRBC and had an
appropriate bump in his hematocrit. He was noted to have [**Known lastname **]
guaiac positive stool, but this was in the setting of extensive
bleeding from Internal Jugular catheter site into his
trach/mouth. His hematocrit should be followed as an outpatient,
and his stools should be continued to check guauic studies for
trace blood.
.
6. Bleeding from Central Line site. He is maintained on coumadin
for Atrial Fibrillation and his inital INR was therapeutic.
After IJ placement, he had continued oozing from IJ site leading
to anemia with hct 19.   He was given FFP and vitamin K (0.5 mg
iv) to reverse his coagultopathy. He should be restarted on
coumadin for Atrial Fibrillation at rehab.
.
5. Diabetes Mellitis: He was continued on glargine and regular
insulin sliding scale. His sugars were in good control.
.
6. Pain/anxiety/depression:
He was continued on his outpatient doses of Fentanyl
75mcg/q72hours, Haldol for anxiety 5mg hs, 2mg 8am/2pm, 1mg
tid/prn, and paxil.   His pain is from his scaral decubitus
ulcer.
.
7. Sacral Decubitus: He was seen by wound care nurse and
continued on DSD for sacral wound.
.
8. Left Upper Extremity Swelling: He had U/S which showed...
.
9. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: He was given lasix prn to
keep fluid even.
.
10.Code: FULL
.
11. Dispo: Discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehab.
.
12. Access: The Right Internal Jugular Vein triple lumen
catheter was not discontinued per [**Hospital1 296**] request. This was
placed on [**2179-3-21**].
------
Outstanding issues on discharge:
1.The pt was started on coumadin at 5 mg qday on day of
discharge [**3-26**].  Please monitor his INR and adjust dose
accordingly.
2.The pt has a swollen L arm and had U/S on day of discharge to
r/o clot. No read has been given yet. Please call [**Hospital1 18**] to
follow this up. Regardless, he is being restarted on
anticoagulation which would be treatment of choice.

management of respiratory distress.  The patient reports that
she has had progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion and a
cough productive of whitish sputum over the past several months,
and that these symptoms prompted her CT chest in [**8-4**] that
demonstrated her pulmonary metastasis.  She states that over the
past 2 days, she has had worsening shortness of breath such that
she is now unable to climb [**11-27**] flight of stairs. She also
endorses some right sided chest pain that is not pleuritic,
which she states has been intermitent for several months. She
denies any f/c/s, palpitaitons, n/v/d, sore throat, LBP, or
myalgias.

CXR ([**2180-10-29**]):
Ill-defined hazy opacities in both lungs, worse within the left
perihilar
region, with increased size of the cardiac silhouette and small
left pleural effusion. Findings most likely relate to pulmonary
edema. Underlying infection or neoplasm, as noted on the prior
CT within the left lung cannot be discerned on this exam.
.
TTE ([**2180-10-30**]):
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). There is no aortic
valve stenosis. There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
The effusion appears circumferential. There is brief right
atrial diastolic collapse. There is brief right ventricular
diastolic compression/collapse, consistent with impaired
fillling/tamponade physiology. Moderate pericardial effusion
with echo evidence of tamponade.
.
CT Chest With Contrast ([**2180-10-30**]):
No evidence of pulmonary embolism. Massive progression of
disease with substantial generalized severe mediastinal and
hilar lymphadenopathy, newly appeared bilateral pleural
effusions, newly appeared pericardial effusion, newly appeared
multifocal pneumonia, and evidence of lymphangitis
carcinomatosa.
.
TTE ([**2180-10-31**]):
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There is a very small pericardial effusion which is partially
echodense. The pericardium may be thickened but is not well
visualized. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2180-10-30**], the pericardial effusion is now much smaller.
.
CXR [**2180-11-2**]:
IMPRESSION: Further progression of metastatic breast cancer
disease with
pericardial effusion, extensive infiltrates in left lower lobe,
and additional
probably metastatic spread in other lung regions. It cannot be
decided
whether the described findings have any relevance to
therapeutically-induced
fluid overload.
.
ECHO [**2180-11-3**]: Conclusions
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
circumferential. The effusion is echo dense, consistent with
blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
IMPRESSION: Small circumferential pericardial effusion.
Bilateral pleural effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
52 year old woman with a PMH significant for metastatic breast
cancer with lung and brain metastases admitted originally to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for management of respiratory distress, then transferred to
CCU after pericardiocentesis for cardiac tampoande, then
transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 2035**] after pt's respiratory status stabilized.
.
#. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: On presentation to the ICU, the
patient denied any fevers but reported a productive cough of
several months duration. CXR on arrival demonstrated left
peri-hilar and basilar infiltrates with concern for infectious
consolidation/pneumonia, pleural effusion or progression of
metastatic disease as her cancer was known to be located in the
left lower lobe. A CT with contrast was performed to further
evaluate the intrapulmonary process and demonstrated a
multifocal pneumonia, progression of the pulmonary metastases,
pleural effusions as well as a moderate-to-large pericardial
effusion (see below for management of pericardial effusion) but
was negative for a pulmonary embolism. Given productive cough
and radiographic evidence the patient was started on Levaquin
and Vancomycin for robust CAP treatment. On review of her
medical chart, HCAP was considered more likely and she was
started on Levoquin and Cefipime. Blood and urine cultures were
performed and showed no growth as well as an Influenza DFA,
which was negative. The patient was maintained on oxygen by
nasal canula to maintain an oxygen saturation greater than 90%.
Urine culture showed no growth though UA was positive for
leukocytes, as she was already on broad spectrim antibiotics, no
additional coverage was added. Antibiotics were changed to
Levaquin and flagyl to cover postobstructive pneumonia, she will
finish a course of 8 days on [**2180-11-8**]. On [**10-31**], patient spiked
fever to 100.9 and cefipime was restarted. After arrival to
[**Name (NI) 2035**], pt remained afebrile and cultures were negative, so
Cepfepime was dc'd again.  Pulmonary was consulted and per their
recs, Vanc was restarted and Flagyl was dc'd after 5 days.  Pt
ultimately completed 8d of Levoquin and at time of discharge,
Vanc was changed to Linezolid to complete the course at home.
Cough was treated symptomatically.  Pt was discharged with O2
suppl.
.
#. Pericardial Effusion: Patient was tachycardic on
presentation. There was concern that it may be related to the
patient's hypoxia or another underlying process such as a PE or
possibly hypovolemia. Antibiotics for her pneumonia as above.
Intravenous fluids were given for hypovolemia with little change
in heart rate. A CT was ordered as above to evaluate further,
which was negative for a pulmonary embolism but did reveal a
moderate-to-large pericardial effusion. A TTE was ordered to
evaluate further and revealed evidence of tamponade physiology.
Moreover, the patient had a pulsus paradoxus of 16-18 mm Hg on
exam. The interventional cardiology service was contact[**Name (NI) **] who
performed pericardiocentesis which produced 470mL serosanguanous
fluid which was consistent with exudate by lites criteria. Over
the next day, the drain put out another 500cc of fluid. The
fluid was sent for cultures which were all negative.  Cytology
on pericarial fluid was positive for malignant cells. After one
day, the pericardial drain was pulled, and the tip sent for
culture which was also negative, and the patient was transfered
out of the CCU. After arrival to [**Name (NI) 2035**], pt remained stable on NC,
however clinically appeared still distressed.  On [**2180-11-3**], a
repeat ECHO was performed and it showed small pericardical
effusion, reassuring us that the fluid had not reaccumulated.
Per Cardiology recs, pt was instrusted to get another repeat
ECHO on [**2180-11-22**] when she return for her outpt appt with
oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**] will follow-up on the ECHO
results.
.
# Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Patient presented with a mild
metabolic acidosis and an anion gap of 15. The most immediate
concern was for a lactic acidosis from her respiratory distress
and impaired tissue oxygenation or a possible starvation
ketosis. Repeat labs the morning after admission revealed a
worsening of her acidosis with a HCO3 of 15 (down from 20 on
admission). An ABG revealed an appropriate respiratory
compensation with a pCO2 of 31. The metabolic acidosis soon
resolved and pt remained stable.
.
# Breast cancer: CT on admission showed dramatic progression of
metastatic disease involving the lungs bilaterally. She was
continued on capecitabine 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **], and transfered to the
oncology service. Once on [**Hospital1 2035**], given pt's breast cancer was
progressing on current therapy (CA27-29 rising) and pt's
clinical status was deteriorating, inpt attending and outpt
oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**] discussed started a new chemotherapy
regimen.  Thus, pt's capecitabine was stopped and on [**2180-11-3**] pt
was given Herceptin, Docetaxel and Carboplatin.  20 minutes into
the infusion, Herceptin was stopped bc pt developed SOB and
hypoxia to mid 80s.  Pt's symptoms resolved with time, Ativan
and Lasix.  Herceptin was attempted again on [**2180-11-6**].  This
time the infusion was stopped 60 min into the infusion bc pt
developed tachycardia. Pt's symptoms resolved with time.  Pt was
started on Neupogen 24 hours after chemotherapy administration
to prevent neutropenia.  The Neupogen was discontinued on day of
discharge as pt's WBC was still >15.
.
# Elevated LFTs: Pt had midly elevated LFTs after chemo
administration, which were trending down with time.
.
# Diarrhea:  Pt developed diarrhea during the hospitalization.
C diff was negative.  Likely [**12-28**] chemo.  Diarrhea improved with
Imodium.
.
# Anemia: Hematocrit on admission was approximately 39, at the
patient's known baseline. The patient subsequently received
several liters of intravenous fluids for her tachycardia and her
hematocrit came down to 35. Pt's Hct remained stable in the
31-35 range.  Pt did not require any transfusions.
.
# Crohn's: Patient was continued on her Mesalamine without
event.
.
# Pt was on regular diet.  Pt was full code.  Pt was on SC
Heparin for DVT ppx.

It was a pleasure to participate in your care Ms. [**Known lastname 284**].
You were admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath.  We
found that you had extra fluid around your heart and you had a
drain placed to remove the fluid.  We also found that you had
worsened metastatic breast cancer that has spread to your lungs.
 This made it difficult for you to breathe.  We started new
chemotherapy, which helped to improve your symptoms.  We also
treated you for pneumonia during your hospitalization.  You will
go home with supplemental oxygen.

Please make the following changes to your medications:
1. Stop xeloda
2. Please start linazolid 600 mg twice a day for three days (you
will finish course on [**2180-11-10**]
3. Start metoprolol 12.5 mg twice a day - this medication helps
to slow your heart rate
4. Start benzonatate 100 mg Capsule every 4 hours as needed for

History of Present Illness:
65 year-old gentleman with multiple medical problem including
history of lung cancer post right pneumonectomy in [**2174**], severe
COPD, post tracheostomy and [**Year (4 digits) 282**] placement(respiratory failure
due to pneumonia) recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for urosepsis, now
presenting yet again with hypotension and altered mental status.

Patient unable to give a history at this time so obtained from
records. Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] on [**3-26**] after an admission
at [**Hospital1 18**] for a Klebsiella UTI and hypotension. Since his
admission there, the pt has been alert and getting out of bed to
the commode with assistance. On [**4-11**], the pt became lethargic
and then gradually unresponsive. On [**4-12**], his BP decreased to
60 over palp and the pt was noted to be diaphoretic. He received
a 500 cc bolus with an increase in his BP to 90/40. He remained
unresponsive during this time. ABG showed 7.265/92.7/82 on an
FiO2 of 0.50 with a temperature of 99.4. Of note, pt's triple
lumen was placed [**2179-3-21**].
.
Wife later arrived at the hospital and was able to provide
additional history. She reports that he had been doing very well
until Friday. They were working on weaning him and he was able
to be on the trach mask for 1-2 hours at a time. However, on
Friday, the pt felt mildly more SOB per his report. He was
maintained exclusively on the vent over the rest of the weekend.
Yesterday, the pt's wife reports that he looked ""very scared""
and would often stare at the ceiling. He also had periods of his
eyes ""rolling back in his head"". He was occasionally responsive
to her. She reports that they had been checking ABGs over the
last 24 hours and his CO2 had been elevated. When they changed
the vent settings to decrease the CO2, she felt that he was
slightly less confused. She also notes that he was very
diaphoretic yesterday and his faced appeared red and swollen.
The pt's BP has always been very low in his left arm and she
reports that they just starting taking his pressure there due to
a skin tear on the right.
.
In the ED, the pt's VS were, 99.8 85 80/60-L 150/80-R 20 100% AC
400/20/100%/PEEP 5. He received vancomyicin and zosyn. Pt was
initially started on levophed for hypotension. However, after
learning that his BP has always been considered to be abnormally
low in the left arm, it was checked in the right and has been
stable in the 120s off of pressors. No new consolidation on CXR.

studies:
ECG- Sinus rhythm at 72 beats per minute. Nonspecific ST-T wave
changes but no major changes since previous studies.
.
CXR- Stent projecting over the right brachiocephalic vein. Right
lung remains opacified with shift of the cardiac and mediastinal
contours toward the right consistent with previous
pneumonectomy. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle
which could represent pleural thickening or small left pleural
effusion. Slightly increased interstitial markings int he left
lung which appear stable. No new left pneumo or focal
consolidation.
.
Head CT (WET READ)- No hemorrhage, shift, mass effect, or
evidence of hydrocephalus. No evidence of a major CVA.

US upper extremity:IMPRESSION:
1) Nonocclusive thrombus in the left cephalic vein.
2) Nonocclusive thrombus in the distal left brachial veins

Transabdominal ultrasound examination was performed. The
gallbladder is not distended. There is an 8-9 mm stone located
at the neck of the gallbladder. The gallbladder wall is
thickened. There are possible crystal or tiny cholesterol polyps
located at the fundus of the gallbladder. No intra or
extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation is identified. The common
duct is not dilated and measures 3 mm. Flow in the portal vein
is anterograde. Limited evaluation of the liver demonstrates no
focal abnormality.

IMPRESSION: Thickened gallbladder wall with a stone in the
gallbladder neck in a nondistended gallbladder. In the proper
clinical setting, these findings may be consistent with
cholecystitis. They are not completely typical for acute
cholecystitis. Gallbladder wall thickening may also be produced
by third spacing of fluids. If there is continued clinical
concern for cholecystitis, a HIDA scan may be performed for
further evaluation.

TECHNIQUE: CT images of the chest without the administration of
IV contrast.

COMPARISON: [**2176-9-11**] and [**2179-3-21**].

FINDINGS:
Soft tissue window images demonstrate changes of prior right
pneumonectomy and mediastinal shift towards the right. There is
no pathologic axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.
There is a left pleural effusion. The patient is intubated with
a tracheostomy tube. A stent is again identified within the
right brachiocephalic vein. The heart demonstrates coronary
calcifications, but is normal in size. The main pulmonary artery
appears prominent measuring 3.5 cm.

Lung window images demonstrate multifocal nodular opacities seen
scattered throughout the left lung. No specific areas of
cavitation are identified within these nodules. Atelectasis is
also seen at the left lung base. There is no focal consolidation
or pneumothorax. Septal thickening is seen throughout the left
lung field. A small 3-mm nodule seen on the prior studies is
again seen, though slightly difficult to discern given the
surrounding septal thickening and nodular opacities. However, on
the study from [**2179-3-21**], this nodule was clearly seen and appears
stable dating back to [**2176-9-11**]. The bronchi appear patent to the
segmental level within the left lung.

Images of the upper abdomen demonstrate high-density material
within dependent portion of the gallbladder, probably relating
to sludge. A percutaneous gastrostomy tube is seen within the
stomach. The remainder of the visualized portion of the upper
abdomen is unremarkable other than arterial calcifications. The
soft tissues are unremarkable. Degenerative changes are seen
throughout the thoracic spine.

IMPRESSION:
1) Multifocal nodular opacities seen scattered throughout the
entire left lung. These most likely represent aspiration
pneumonia. Septic emboli are considered less likely based on the
CT appearance.
2) Mild CHF.
3) Left upper lobe nodule seen on the prior study of [**2179-3-21**]
demonstrates stability dating back to [**2176-9-11**].
4) Probable sludge within the gallbladder.
5) Findings suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial
hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
65 y/o man with PMH significant for squamous cell lung CA, type
2 DM, atrial fib, and multiple past pneumonias admitted from
[**Hospital1 **] with mental status change and hypotension.

#ID/sepsis
Patient had fever and leukocytosis initially with fluctuating
blood pressure, lactate 1.3. His blood pressure in the ED was
measured on the left arm (which is typically much lower). His
blood pressure on the right was found to be normal and pressors
were off. Sputum culture was sent(colonized with pseudomonas),
blood culture, urine culture and cath tip culture negative on
discharge. His decubitus ulcer looks clean. His line was resited
line to the right femoral. Chest CT was consistent with
aspiration pneumonia. He will be continued on zosyn for 14 days.
He remained afebrile and no pressors required throughout the
rest of his hospital stay.

#Mental status changes:
His mental status improved with decreasing CO2 and also with
narcan. His CO2 remained well controlled in the hospital and was
at baseline in 70s. CT head was negative. Narcotics was taken
into consideration as possible cause of mental status changes.
Patient's duragesic patch was removed in the ED.

#anemia/coagulation
Patient has history of deep venous thrombosis with IVC filter
and SVC clot and also atrial fibrillation for which he was on
coumadin. COumadin was taken off 3 days prior to hospital
admission because he had blood oozing from his trach and foley.
In hospital, central line was attempted intially on the right
subclavian but the artery was puctured. His right femoral artery
was also punctured and he did lose a signifcant amount of blood.
The 2 arterial puncture was tamponaded and there was no
hematoma. He also got an ultrasound of uppper extremity which
revealed DVT in left arm for which he was started on heparin
drip. He then had mild guiac negative stool and oozing from
arterial line site. Heparin drip was then stopped and he was
given 2 unit of transfusion. His hematocrit had been stable
since then. On discharge, coumadin was not restarted. It should
be restarted in 1-2days time if the hematocrit remain stable.
.
#transaminitis
He presented intially with transaminitis likely from
hypotension. LFTS trended down on discharge. RUQ ultrasound was
done which showed gallstone at neck of GB, no distension,
thickened gallbladder. He remained afebrile and has no abdominal
tenderness

#respiratory:
Patient has squamous cell lung CA post right pneumonectomy and
post tracheostomy. During his past admission there was concern
about cuff leak and possible tracheomalacia. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
recommended keeping the cuff pressures low with a cuff leak to
prevent further tracheamalacia. Possible change the trach to a
foam-filled trach ([**Last Name (un) 295**] tube) in the future if the cuff leak
is interfering with the ability to ventilate. He remained on
assist control ventilation.
.
# [**Name (NI) 300**] Pt with mildly elevated Na at 148. This is most
likely due to water deficit as he can not drink to replace his
needs. He recieved free water through G tube.
.
# Cardiac
Patient has long history of atypical chest pain but has no such
complain during this hospitalization. Cardiac enzymes were
unremarkable. He was continued on aspirin and also amiodarone
for atrial fibrillation. He is to avoid beta blockers and
calcium channel blockers because of profound bradycardia.
.
#Type 2 diabetes mellitus
Patient was continued on standing 8U glargine and sliding scale
while in hospital.

#Anxiety/pain
Patient's family reports that he is extemely anxious at
baseline. He was continues on his outpatient doses of Haldol for
anxiety 5mg hs, 2mg 8am/2pm, 1mg tid/prn, and paxil. His pain is
from his scaral decubitus ulcer and back pain. Anxiety has been
severely worsened in the past with ativan. Would avoid further
ativan. Fentanyl patch was discontinued since there was a
concern regarding narcotic overdose. He was on prn morphine.
THis should be adjusted in [**Hospital1 **].

# Sacral Decubitus:
He had Kinair bed

# FEN
Tube feeds was continued with no residual

#access
He had picc line on discharge

#code
OK with pressor, do not resuscitate(confirmed again with family
meeting)

[**2119-5-16**] Upper GI : In this patient status post gastric bypass and
partial gastrectomy with repair
of marginal ulcer, there is free flow of contrast through the
gastric pouch and the gastrojejunostomy. No leak or holdup of
contrast identified in this study.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 303**] was admitted to the hospital and examined by the
Bariatric service. He had no abdominal pain but had Dilaudid
prior to his transfer.  His cardiac work up was negative and due
to the finding of pneumoperitoneum on abd CT he was taken to the
Operating Room for an exploratory laparotomy. He had a
perforated marginal ulcer and underwent a partial gastrectomy,
omental patch to ulcer and a cholecystectomy. He tolerated the
procedure well and returned to the ICU in stable condition.
His pain was controlled with a Dilaudid PCA and he remained
hemodynamically stable.
He was subsequently transferred to the Surgical floor for
further management.

Due to his recent surgery and length of time prior to taking
fluids he had a PICC line placed for TPN which began on [**2119-5-14**]
through a right AC PICC line.  This was continued until [**2119-5-18**].
In the interim he had an upper GI on [**2119-5-16**] which showed no
anastomotic leak and he gradually began a stage 1 diet.  This
was slowly advanced over the next 24 hours to stage 3 and he had
no trouble with nausea or fullness.

His abdominal wound was healing well and he was up and walking
independently.  He remained free of any pulmonary complications
post op by using his incentive spirometer.  Roxicet was
effective in treating his incisional pain and he was generally
improving every day.

After an uncomplicated course he was discharged to home on
[**2119-5-18**] and will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks.

History of Present Illness:
85-year-old female atrial fibrillation, schizophrenia, dementia
presents from nursing home with respiratory distress.
.
The patient was in her usual state of health until this AM. At
that time she was found by nursing home staff in respiratory
distress with O2 sats of 70% on RA. EMS was contact[**Name (NI) **] and she
was started on supplemental oxygen with NRB and O2 sats
responded to 98%. She was also noted to be hot (no document of
temperature) with cough and green sputum. She was transported to

.
IMAGING:
[**2179-1-29**] EKG #1: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response. Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay. Left
ventricular hypertrophy. Poor R wave progression could be due to
left ventricular hypertrophy. Non-specific ST-T wave changes
could be due to left ventricular hypertrophy, although cannot
exclude ischemia. Clinical correlation is suggested. No previous
tracing available for comparison.

[**2179-1-29**] EKG #2: Atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular
response. Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay. Left
ventricular hypertrophy. Poor R wave progression could be due to
left ventricular hypertrophy. Non-specific ST-T wave changes
could be due to left ventricular hypertrophy, although cannot
exclude ischemia. Compared to tracing #1 ventricular rate is
slower.

[**2179-1-29**] CXR:
1. Mild pulmonary edema.
2. Mild cardiomegaly.
3. Hyperexpanded lungs, could be due to emphysema.

[**2179-1-29**] CTA Head/Neck:
1. Acute right MCA distribution infarction with acute occlusion
demonstrated within the right middle cerebral artery. No
collateral flow.
2. No evidence of vascular dissection. Mild atherosclerotic
plaque as
detailed above.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 year old female with a history of schizophrenia and dementia
who presented in repiratory distress and was found to have a new
MCA stroke. After goals of care discussion with patient's
guardian, she was made comfort measures only, and expired on
[**2179-2-2**].

#. Respiratory Distress: Patient's O2 sats were in high 90s on
NRB on arrival to ED.  She was noted to be in afib with RVR, and
CXR was concerning for pulmonary edema.  Patient was treated
with nitro gtt, diltiazem, aspirin, levofloxacin and furosemide.
BiPAP attempted, but patient did not tolerate well; developed
hypotension and increased tachycardia.  She was admitted to the
ICU for further evaluation and management of respiratory
distress. After Code Stroke called on arrival to ICU in setting
of left hemiparesis (see below), and imaging revealed large R
MCA infarct, decision was made to focus on comfort care only.
Patient transferred to floor, where she received morphine as
needed for pain and SOB.
.
#. CVA: On arrival to ICU, patient was noted to have left
hemiparesis.  Code Stroke called, and CT Head/Neck revealed
right MCA infarct. Given the history of recent falls and her
limited pre-stroke functionality, the decision was made not to
give heparin or tPA.  After discussion with the patient's
guardian, it was felt that she would not want to pursue
aggressive treatment given poor prognosis, and patient was made
CMO.
.
#. Atrial fibrillation: Patient noted to be in afib with RVR on
presentation.  She was initially on diltiazem gtt, but this was
discontinued once patient made CMO.
.
#. Rash: Patient noted to have papular rash on erythematous
background on neck and abdomen.  Was felt to be most likely
secondary to a drug rash.  Of note, patient received lasix,
which may have caused reaction as patient has history of sulfa
allergy.  Patient received sarna lotion as needed, as well as
hydrocortisone cream.
.
#. Goals of care: Per discussion with patient's guardian,
patient's code status changed to comfort measures only.  Plan
was for discharge back to skilled nursing facility with hospice,
however patient expired on [**2179-2-2**] prior to discharge.  Her
guardian was notified, and declined an autopsy.

History of Present Illness:
60F with ESRD s/p deceased donor renal transplant, HTN, and
diverticulitis who was initially admitted for worsening
abdominal pain and N/V and now presents to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with
hypotension after having a n ex-lap and bowel resection for a
perforated cecum.  She has had approximately 3 episodes of
diverticulitis in the past year which resolved with antibiotics.
 She was planning to have an elective outpatient laparoscopic
colectomy given her frequent flares.  Prior to this admission,
she reportedly had intermittent [**10-3**] abdominal pain in the RLQ
and LLQ and significant nausea and vomiting, she was unable to
keep down any POs for 48 hours prior to admission.  This felt
worse than her prior diverticulitis flares and she was admitted
for observation, hydration, and antibiotics.  CT abd/pelvis at
admission showed pericolonic stranding but no e/o
diverticulitis.

Since admission to the surgery service, she was staretd on Cipro
and Flagyl for the colitis seen on CT.  Her abdominal pain
acutely worsened on [**5-12**] and she described feeling a ""[**Doctor Last Name **]"" in
her abdomen.  A repeat CT abd/pelvis showed perforation at the
cecum with free air present and extravasation of PO contrast
into the peritoneum.  She was taken to the OR for a ex-lab where
she was found to have a stricture in the signoid colon and a
perforation in her cecum with spillage of stool in to the
peritoneum.  She underwent a right and left colectomy, the
transverse colon was left in place but is discontinusous.  Her
abdomen was left open after the procedure.

PORTABLE ABDOMEN Study Date of [**2114-5-12**] 8:07 PM
Supine and decubitus view of the abdomen shows pneumoperitoneum,

not present on the abdomen CT [**5-11**], but detected on the chest
radiograph
performed concurrently and reported prior to review of this
study. Retained contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**] in the cecum shows its diameter
is 8 cm.  Proximal to it, the small bowel is moderately
distended to a diameter of 28 mm.  A subsequent abdominal CT
scan also available at the time of this review shows the effects
of likely cecal perforation.

IMAGING:
-[**5-12**] CT Abd:
IMPRESSION:
1.  There is evidence of new bowel perforation at the level of
the cecum, with evidence of new free air, free fluid, as well as
extraluminal oral contrast surrounding the cecum.  Surgical
consultation is recommended.
2.  Pericolonic stranding is again noted diffusely throughout
the colon and greatest throughout the descending and sigmoid
colon.  These findings are most consistent with diffuse colitis
which has likely led to perforation.
3. New small bilateral pleural effusions

Cardiovascular Report ECG Study Date of [**2114-5-14**]  11:12:58 AM
Sinus rhythm with low amplitude P waves. Low QRS voltage
throughout.
Delayed R wave transition. Diffuse non-specific T wave
flattening. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2112-7-15**] the
voltage is lower. P wave amplitude has decreased. Diffuse T wave
flattening is present. Clinical correlation is suggested.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2114-5-15**] 3:19 AM
No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Low endotracheal tube
position.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 1119**], a patient known to the colorectal surgery service,
presented to the emergency department on [**2114-5-11**] with nausea,
vomiting, and abdominal pain. She was diagnosed with
diverticulitis and she was evaluated by the acute care service
in the emergency department and a plan was formulated with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] to admit the patient for abdominal exams, antibiotics and
rehydration with plan to monitor and expedite surgical plans
based on her medical history and sudden relapse of symptoms
while on outpatient antibiotic therapy. Nephrology was consulted
for advice related to immunosuppression medications and past
renal transplant and followed the patient for the duration of
her inpatient admission. On [**2114-5-12**] the patient was monitored
closely. She was started on a clear liquid diet and was given a
Dulcolax Supp x1 and had 2 bowel movements. She remained
distended and was given a dose of milk of magnesia. The patient
was improving when she had a sudden onset of abdominal pain. CT
revealed extravasation of contrast and she was taken to the
operating room with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for exploratory laparotomy and
two segmental colectomies, was left with open abdomen and
disconnected and because of the difficult case and condition of
bowel as described in the operative note, the patient was
transferred to the intensive care unit appropriate drains. On
[**2114-5-14**] the patient returned to the operating room with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] after stabilization in the ICU for washout, completion
proctectomy and colectomy, ileostomy and closure of the abdomen
with retention sutures and staples. The patient was transferred
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and the course of ICU care is described below.

[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course per [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] resident:
60F with ESRD s/p deceased renal transplant in [**2095**] on
immunosuppression, HTN and h/o diverticulitis who presented to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with hypotension after ex-lap with right/left
hemicolectomy performed for cecal perforation and sigmoid
stricture.
.
#Cecal perforation s/p colectomy:  The cause of her perforation
was thought to be a sigmoid stricture which was found
intraoperatively, likely related to her multiple episodes of
diverticulitis.   She had a primary anastomosis and loop
ileostomy. She was commenced on vanc/Zosyn for an 8 day course
per surgery, and was maintained on a morphine PCA prn. She was
intubated for the procedure, but was quickly and successfully
weaned off of the vent prior to callout to the surgical floor.
.
# Hypertension ?????? Her initial hypotension resolved, and her home
anti-hypertensives were recommenced due to her hx of HTN.
.
#ESRD s/p renal transplant: renal transplant recs were followed,
and after her procedure, she was restarted on azathioprine, and
transitioned to a 5mg daily dose of prednisone. She was
restarted on cyclosporine per renal transplant on [**5-17**]. .
#Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: Resolved. Likely related to
volume resuscitation with NS. Chloride is also elevated which
supports this.
.
#Anemia: Hct trending down almost 10 points compared to her
pre-op CBC.  Likely from blood loss during her colectomy as well
as dilutional effect from multiple fluid boluses.  She was also
hemoconcentrated at admission from poor PO intake and has
baseline anemia with Hct in the 24-32 range from her ESRD s/p
transplant. She was transfused with packed red blood cells. She
was monitored closely.

The patient was extubated and started on a clear liquid diet on
[**2114-5-17**].

Surgical Floor Course:

The patient was transferred to the inpatient floor on [**2114-5-18**]
and began a regular diet. She was continued on her antibiotic
course. [**2114-5-19**] the Foley was removed at midnight. The patient
had temporary central venous access which was not ideal for the
floor and because of intravenous antibiotics and the patient's
access status  unable to place PICC line after multiple
attempts. IR was unable to schedule the patient for IR placement
of the PICC line. The nursing staff continued to use the CVL for
access. On [**2114-5-20**] the patient was voiding. She was given
vancomycin 500x1, troughs were monitored closely at the patient
was a renal transplant patient and she was strated on pain
medications by mouth. [**2114-5-21**] Renal transplant fellow:
recommend continuing home dose of immunosuppression medications.
JP drains were removed. The patient was meeting discharge
criteria. She was followed closely throughout her admission by
the wound/ostomy nursing team as well as physical therapy. After
consultation with the nephrology team the patient was started on
a 14 day course of Augmentin started and fluconazole and Zosyn
were discontinued. The PICC line was pulled back to midline
position and the central venous line was removed without issue.
Her cyclosporine trough was monitored closely throughout her
hospitalization as there was a risk of interaction with
fluconazole. Her last trough was 112 on [**2114-5-19**]. She continued
her Cyclosporine and was discharged on appropriate dosing. The
patient was ordered to have the Cyclosporine trough measured
prior to the morning dose on [**2114-5-24**] and dose adjustment with
assistance of the renal transplant center. Arrangements were
arranged for the patient to be transferred to a rehabilitation
facility appropriately as she had become deconditioned. The
midline catheter was removed at time of discharge.

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
[**Hospital **] Hospital for Continuing Medical Care - [**Location (un) 1121**]
([**Hospital3 1122**] Center)

Discharge Diagnosis:
Sigmoid diverticulitis with abscess and stricture, perforated
cecum


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after a laparoscopic
Colectomy for surgical management of your diverticulitis.
Unfortunately after this procedure you were found to have a
stricture and leaking into your abdomen which required you to be
taken back to the operating room for a completion colectomy and
end ileostomy. Closure of the surgical incision required
placement of retention sutures which remain in place and will
stay in place along with the staples until you return for your 2
weeks post-operative visit. You have recovered from this
procedure and you are now ready to return home. Samples from
your colon were taken and this tissue has been sent to the
pathology department for analysis. You will receive these
pathology results at your follow-up appointment. If there is an
urgent need for the surgeon to contact you regarding these
results they will contact you before this time. You have
tolerated a regular diet, passing gas and your pain is
controlled with pain medications by mouth. You may return home
to finish your recovery. It is important that you continue to
have your immunosupression medications monitored for your kidney
transplant. Please have your level checked at rehab the morning
of [**2114-5-24**] and the goal of the cyclosporin level is 50-100. The
rehab should fax this level to the renal transplant office after
it is back for recommendations at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 697**]. This will be
ordered in your paperwork however, it is the facilities
responsibility to order the test.

Please monitor your bowel function closely. If you have any of
the following symptoms please call the office for advice or go
to the emergency room if severe: increasing abdominal
distension, increasing abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
inability to tolerate food or liquids, elevated ileostomy
output. You have a new ileostomy. The most common complication
from a new ileostomy placement is dehydration. The output from
the stoma is stool from the small intestine and the water
content is very high. The stool is no longer passing through the
large intestine which is where the water from the stool is
reabsorbed into the body and the stool becomes formed. You must
measure your ileostomy output for the next few weeks. The output
from the stoma should not be more than 1200cc or less than
500cc. If you find that your output has become too much or too
little, please call the office for advice. The office nurse or
nurse practitioner can recommend medications to increase or slow
the ileostomy output. Keep yourself well hydrated, if you notice
your ileostomy output increasing, take in more electrolyte drink
such as Gatorade. Please monitor yourself for signs and symptoms
of dehydration including: dizziness (especially upon standing),
weakness, dry mouth, headache, or fatigue. If you notice these
symptoms please call the office or return to the emergency room
for evaluation if these symptoms are severe. You may eat a
regular diet with your new ileostomy. However it is a good idea
to avoid fatty or spicy foods and follow diet suggestions made
to you by the ostomy nurses.

Please monitor the appearance of the ostomy and stoma and care
for it as instructed by the wound/ostomy nurses. The stoma
(intestine that protrudes outside of your abdomen) should be
beefy red or pink, it may ooze small amounts of blood at times
when touched and this should subside with time. The skin around
the ostomy site should be kept clean and intact. Monitor the
skin around the stoma for bulging or signs of infection listed
above. Please care for the ostomy as you have been instructed by
the wound/ostomy nurses. You will be able to make an appointment
with the ostomy nurse in the clinic 7 days after surgery. You
will have a visiting nurse at home for the next few weeks
helping to monitor your ostomy until you are comfortable caring
for it on your own. The bridge will be removed from the
ileostomy at your follow-up appointment with the wound/ostomy
nurses.

You have a long vertical incision on your abdomen that is closed
with staples and retention sutures. This incision can be left
open to air or covered with a dry sterile gauze dressing if the
staples become irritated from clothing. The staples will stay in
place until your first post-operative visit at which time they
can be removed in the clinic, most likely by the office nurse.
Please monitor the incision for signs and symptoms of infection
including: increasing redness at the incision, opening of the
incision, increased pain at the incision line, draining of
white/green/yellow/foul smelling drainage, or if you develop a
fever. Please call the office if you develop these symptoms or
go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe. You may
shower, let the warm water run over the incision line and pat
the area dry with a towel, do not rub.

No heavy lifting for at least 6 weeks after surgery unless
instructed otherwise by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. You may
gradually increase your activity as tolerated but clear heavy
exercise with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. You must continue to wear the
abdomoinal binder with a whole cut for the ileostomy to fit
under at least until your second post-operative visit with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. He will give you further instructions at this time.

You will be prescribed a small amount of the pain medication
Please take this medication exactly as prescribed. You may take
Tylenol as recommended for pain. Please do not take more than
4000mg of Tylenol daily. Do not drink alcohol while taking
narcotic pain medication or Tylenol. Please do not drive a car
while taking narcotic pain medication.
Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care! Our hope
is that you will have a quick return to your life and usual
activities. Good luck!

.
## GI bleed: Pt's hematocrit has been stable while in house and
no further evidence of GI bleeding.  Etiology could have been
small [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear vs gastritis.  Pt has no evidence of
cirrhosis by physical exam or labs.  He was maintained on IV PPI
twice a day and denied any further GI sx's.  He will be
discharged on once a day oral protonix.  Scope was initially
deferred because of increased risk [**2-16**] his DT's.  He was
scheduled for scope on the day of discharge but refused.
.
## EtOH withdrawal: pt states has had DT's in past.  Initially
placed in ICU for closer monitoring, where he required large
doses of benzodiazapines for withdrawl (hundreds of milligrams
of valium).  He was also started on scheduled haldol, which he
should continue as an outpt.  Psych was consulted who agreed
with this plan.  Thiamine and folate were continued.  He left
the ICU [**4-14**] and tried to leave the hospital twice, each time
requiring Code Purple to be initiated (psych emergency) where he

## Elevated pancreatic enzymes: Lipase/Amylase >2:1 likely
affected by EtOH, however not elevated to a degree sufficient
enough to call true pancreatitis. Likely elevated [**2-16**] vomiting.
Resolved with no sequelae.
.
##HTN: unclear of pt's outpt regimen: started prn hydral for SBP
>160.  His htn was attributed to the unopposed sympathetic tone
of alcohol withdrawl.

now with suspected withdrawal seizure requring high benzo doses.


1. EtOH withdrawl:

History of Etoh abuse and withdrawal seizure.  He was
intoxicated in the ED and
had a witnessed seizure in that context.  He received in total
about 100mg of valium while in the ED.  He was transferred to
the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU for further monitoring.  He was monitored by CIWA
scale, and required minimal further benzodiazepines.  He
consistently had scores by CIWA scale of 0-2 and had no further
signs/symptoms of withdrawal. He had no further seizures during
his hospital course.

2. Acid-base: Primary hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic
alkalosis likely [**2-16**] vomiting, contraction. AG 22 c/w metabolic
acidosis likely uremic. Lactate wnl 2.2.
These acid/base disturbances, as well as hypokalemia and
hypomagnesemia were all corrected with volume resuscitation and
electrolyte repletion.

3. RLL opacity:

Persistent lung nodule in RLL seen on chest xray.  Initially
started on abx in
ED, but these were d/c in ICU, as there was no clear evidence of
infection.  A chest CT was performed, which demonstrated a 3cm
spiculated RLL nodule, concerning for malignancy, especially
given his smoking history. He will need further f/u and
diagnostic biopsy.  The team discussed the lesion with Mr.
[**Known lastname **], clearly stating that there was a high chance it was
malignant and the best chance of cure would be excision.  Mr.
[**Known lastname **] indicated he understood and would follow up at a clinic
appointment the team set up for him prior to his discharge.

4. ARF:

Consistent with pre-renal azotemia. Resolved with aggressive
volume resuscitation.
No further issues.

5. Follow up:

Complicated social situation with tenuous housing; lives on
street as well as with children.  Seen by SW while in house;
offered etoh counseling/programs, but patient refused.  He will
f/u with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 334**] in [**Hospital 191**] clinic; on discharge, this
appointment was set up.  He will need to apply for MassHealth
coverage as well.
He agreed to f/u, and understands that he needs further f/u for
this lung nodule.

Brief Hospital Course:
50 y/o M w/ h/o ETOH abuse, chronic pancreatitis, who presented
with signs and symptoms of ETOH withdrawal

1. ETOH w/d: Presented with tachycardia, hallucinations,
tremulousness. Given 40mg Valium in ED. Admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and
started on valium CIWA scale. Started on Folate, Thiamine, MVI.
Monitored on telemetry overnight. He had no evidence of seizure
or HD instabilitiy o/n. His CIWA was [**8-23**], mainly based on
agitation and tremulousness, and he recieved an additional 120mg
valium overnight. Early on HD 2 the patient demanded to leave.
It was explained to the patient that he has a high probability
of withdrawal seizure or DT's and that he needed continued ICU
monitoring. The patient reported that he understood this but
still wished to leave against medical advice. He was felt to
have capacity to make this decision since he had no evidence of
delirium and clearly understood his situation and risks
involved. The case was discussed with the on call psychiatry
resident, ICU medicine resident and ICU staff attending.
Therefore the patient signed out AMA on hospital day 2. Prior to
discharge we did have him ambulate around the intensive care
unit and he was able to do this without too much difficuluty,
although he was still a bit tremulous upon discharge. He had no
other evidence of active w/d symptoms.

2. Anion-gap Acidosis: Suspected secondary to ketoacidosis,
likely from poor PO intake. ETOH was negative suggesting against
ETOH related cause. Serum acetone was positive, with a normal
serum osm. His gap closed with IVF hydration.

3. Hypochloremic Metabolic Alkalosis: Secondary to HCL loss from
vomiting. Improved with IVF hydration.

4. Hematemesis: Limited hematemesis early the morning of
admission. He had no further episodes of blood loss and he was
guaiac negative on admission. Hematocrit remained stable
overnight.

5. Abd pain: Suspect secondary to chronic pancreatitis.
Amylase/Lipase unchanged from previous levels. AST/ALT 2:1 in
setting of h/o ETOH abuse. Recent CT ([**4-19**]) negative for liver
or GB dx, only fatty liver.

6. RLL lung mass: Seen on Chest CT from [**4-19**], concerning for
primary lung CA. Has not been worked up further. Not able to set
up follow-up as patient left AMA.
